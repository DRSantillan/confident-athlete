												<p>Fear of failure and perfectionism is so prevalent in my work with athletes that it is becoming rampant in athletics. What you may not know or understand is that <mark>athletes with fear of failure are highly motivated individuals who	want badly to succeed and reach their goals.</mark>	Perfectionists are incredibly motivated to improve and succeed. But	this very positive mindset to use in practice can actually hinder them and undermine perfectionists from reaching peak performance in sports.</p>
												<p><strong>Fearless Athlete</strong> teaches you the same strategies I	teach my personal coaching students when working with athletes in the	area of fear of failure, perfectionism, and trust in sports. By the end of this 14-day program, you will have learned the key mental strategies to help you perform with freedom, fearlessness, and unbeatable trust in virtually any competitive situation!</p>
												<p>
													Many of the athletes I work with focus too much on having the perfect
													performance or fixate on how they will appear to others (such as
													teammates, parents, coaches) when performing. This hidden need to
													execute flawlessly or to look good in competition undermines
													performance during competitive situations. In this workbook, you will
													be asked to look honestly at yourself to discover the beliefs and
													attitudes that keep you stuck in a comfort zone (or a certain
													performance level) and hold you back from reaching your goals.
												</p>
												<p>
													Throughout the next 14 days of this workbook, I will present many
													self-awareness exercises to help you pinpoint your own fears and
													attitudes that block your success. Are you ready to learn unbeatable
													trust? Great! Let’s get started right now!
												</p>
												<h3>How to use this program</h3>
												<p>
													Each day you will be given specific tasks to complete to identify
													mental barriers and improve your mental game. At times you will be
													given awareness exercises to help you identify mindsets that undermine
													or alternately, contribute to success in sports. At the end of 14
													days, you will be well on your way to unbeatable trust.
												</p>
												<p>
													Each day of the program is divided into daily tasks which you need to
													complete. For maximum benefit from each Daily Fearless Strategy, you
													should complete all the tasks, starting with Day 1 and work your way
													to Day 14. You may choose to complete the workbook/audio in 7 days if
													you do 2 days at a time.
												</p>
												<p>
													Use the audio program that accompanies The Fearless Athlete to help
													guide you through the program. For example, open the workbook to Day 1
													and listen to the audio for Day 1. After you complete the audio for
													Day 1, stop and complete the workbook exercises for Day 1 before
													proceeding to Day 2 audio. The table, below, is a description of the
													daily tasks you will complete in each section to enhance your focus.

				For many athletes, fear and fear of failure are a constant source of <mark> stress</mark> or anxiety that sabotages performance. <strong> What is fear?</strong> Miriam-Webster defines fear as <blockquote>“an unpleasant often strong emotion caused by anticipation or awareness of danger.” </blockquote> In tennis, most of the fear athletes refer to is not about being in danger or harming themselves physically. The fear I am talking about is a <mark>psychological threat</mark> that is often based on an <mark>athlete’s perception</mark> of the importance of a performance or game and what others think about his or her performance.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most of the time, an athlete’s fear is <strong>worry related to poor results - whether prior to or during a
					performance.</strong> Athletes often fear the negative consequences of their performance. They worry about
				many things that are often not under their control.

			<h4>Assessing your results: </h4>
			<p>
				If you checked “yes” to five or more of the statements above, it’s a good bet that <mark>fear of failure hinders your focus in competition</mark> and causes a lack of trust.
			</p>
			<p>If you
				checked “yes” to one or more statements above, you still may need to address this mental game barrier as you may have at least some perfectionistic tendencies.</p>
			<h4>What are the common types of fears for tennis players?</h4>
			<p>Its not enough to know that you have fear of failure. Whats more important is to know what type of fear holds you back. As you can see from the list below, fear of failure often is related to what you assume others think about you.</p>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Fear of losing a match or game</strong> - you badly want to win and are afriad you will not win.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Fear of negative social evalution</strong> - you fear others will view you as a failure in tennis.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Fear of embarrasment</strong> - you are afraid to enbarrass yourself in front of others if you dont perform well.</li>
					<li><strong>Fears of letting others down</strong> - you do not want to lwt others down such as a couch or parent.</li>
					<li><strong>Fear of puttin in the effort and not ever getting the "pay off"</strong> or not playing to your potential. You dont want tour hard work, talent and long practices to result in nothing. (wins, trphiesm
						etc)</li>
					<li><strong>Fear of not performing up to others expectations</strong> - you worry about not meeting others expectations for you</li>
					<li><strong>Fear of being rejected</strong>, losing respect, or not gaining approval.</li>
					<li><strong>Fear of making mistakes</strong> and not performing perfectly after having worked so hard at it.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p><strong><mark>Do any of the above fears sound familiar to you?</mark></strong> </p>
			<p>The first step in managing your fear of failure is to understand the specific source of your fear. By the end of the 14-day program, I will help you overcome the fears outlined here.</p>`

			I work with many athletes who have perfectionistic behaviors or tendencies. I don’t know why this is… Do some sports instill perfectionism? Some traits of perfectionism are very helpful to improving your performance as I discuss in Day #3. However, my experience shows that fear of failure is closely related to perfectionism in sports. Athletes who are perfectionistic (and highly motivated) do not perform up to their potential because of fear of failure.
			<p>
			It is ironic that the athlete to want to win the most, a train the most are often those who are the most likely to be mentally stuck in fear of failure. perfectionistic athletes often lose sight of the real golden sports–To use training to perform well in competition. 
			</p>
			<p>
			They become so engrossed in training and practice that perfecting their technique or working hard in practice becomes a primary goal instead of performing with confidence in competition. And when they do compete, they believe in anything but perfect execution or winning is deemed as failure.

					Many perfectionist the athletes, coaches, and sport parents don't
					understand how tried to be perfect and competitioncan reduce the
					chance of being successful in tennis. After all humans are led to
					believe that we should strive to be perfect.However, striving for
					perfection is not the same as expecting perfection. For
					perfectionistic athletes, there is not a clear line between striding
					toward in practice and <strong>expecting perfection</strong> in
					competition, which is likely to fear of failure.
				</p>
				<p>
					Perfectionism is a necessarily About quality. Some of the qualities of
					perfectionists are very functional to performance. For example, a
					strong work ethic, commitment two goals, and having a desire to learn
					and improve a very positive characteristics that all athletes should
					embrace. Perfectionists are often very motivated and this helps them
					want to train harder than anyone to become successful.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, perfectionist traits become a problem when they negatively
					impact performance and hinder success.The biggest challenge with
					perfectionism comes down to how you handle competitive environments.
					If you try to be perfect competition,You sanitised your ability to
					perform. although trying to be perfect may sound logical, it is
					counter-productive to the performance of your motor skills and causes
					you to lose self trust(the concept I will cover the details later in
					this workbook).
				</p>
				<p>
					The downside of perfectionism is that you harbour strict expectations
					about your performance, are afraid of failing,You worry too much about
					results such as personal gangster statistics or winning. moreover, in
					my experience, I found it difficult to convince perfectionists that is
					straight hold them back in sports.Some of my students resist changing
					their behaviour because it has, in part, help them achieve some rather
					lofty goals.
				</p>
				<p>
					One pitfall of perfectionism is harbouring high expectations of your
					performance, which feeding to get more problems.When you don't achieve
					your expectations, it is easy feel frustrated and feel as if you are
					failing. You might think too much about outcomes such as sports as
					statistics and this causes anxiety and worry about failing. The end
					result is that you ultimately conform at a less level then your full
					potential.This leads to a variety of other problems such as
					confidence, composure and focus issues

					The very first step is to identify the beliefs, attitudes, and
					expectations that cause you to hold onto your over-exactness in
					competition and lead to fear of failure. You want to keep the positive
					aspects of your mental game such as your motivation and commitment to
					sport. However, you most likely maintain beliefs or attitudes that
					support a fearful, cautious, or over-seriousness attitude when
					performing, such as
					<mark>“I must be perfect if I want to win today”</mark> or
					<mark
						>“I must analyze my mistakes and fix them right away so I don’t make
						the same mistake.”</mark

					These may sound good, but actually hinder your ability to play well.
				</p>
				<p>
					These behaviors (<strong>what I call core beliefs or attitudes</strong

					and help to keep you stuck. Most of your expectations, especially
					perfectionistic ones do not help you perform freely in the present
					moment. Expectations and non-functional attitudes are often formed

					My definition of <mark>“expectation”</mark> may surprise you. I define expectations as strict demands or judgments you have about your performance. Expectations are not the same as having confidence in your ability to perform well such as having confidence in your ability to get a hit or make a lay up. Expectations are demands you place on your performance and cause you to judge how you are doing compared to how you think you <strong>SHOULD</strong> be doing.
				</p>
				<p>
					What is the difference between “expectation” and “confidence?” Confidence is simply a belief in your ability such as “I believe I can get a hit and advance the
					runner on first base.” But this is not a dire need when talking about confidence – only a belief in ability to do this. Expectation is more absolute and judgmental. Expectation often comes with added pressure.
				</p>
				<p>
					Having strict, perfectionist or unrealistic expectations can undermine your sports confidence. This is especially true when you feel that you are not meeting your own performance expectations. Essentially, high expectations set you up for failure before you even begin a competition.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition, expectations are usually about results such as obtaining
					a specific school or achieving personal statistic such as batting
					average. Judge yourself or your game based on these expectations. You
					then focus too much on outcomes, schools, or sister thinks which
					distract you from focusing on the process of execution. your goal is
					to identify and replace result expectations with simple goals that
					focus on execution.

					If you are familiar with my work, you may well know one of my formulas for success in sports. My formula is to identify and replace expectations with high confidence and manageable goals. The very first step is to flush out the expectations that cause you to pressure yourself or worry too much about results.
				</p>
				<p>
					Below are questions that help you identify strict expectations that underlie perfectionism and fear of failure:
				</p>
				<div class="container">
					<div class="container__row">
						1. Do your “goals” for a competition focus on outcomes or results
						only? (Expectations can often be disguised as goals.)

					Your goal should be to play without any expectations – good or bad. Your expectations set you up for failure and only cause you to judge how well you are doing. Using the expectations you listed in your workbook above, your task is to replace each expectations with a statement of confidence. I will give you an example of how this works.

					Do you have a little devil or a little angel on your shoulder after you make mistakes? One of the challenges you have to overcome as a perfectionist is learning how to cope better with errors when you are not performing well. Highly motivated athletes with perfectionistic tendencies are particularly prone to becoming upset and frustrated with mistakes or when not performing up to expectations.
				</p>
				<p>
					The goal of today’s lesson is to teach you strategies to help you keep eventempered, level-headed, or calm mind, especially after mistakes.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a perfectionistic athlete, I know you can be hard on yourself. Your internal dialogue or mental chatter, known as self-talk, can be very negative and critical, especially when you are not performing well. At any given moment, your self-talk can be positive or negative about your performance. You most likely engage in name-calling with yourself such as, “I’m a choker and can’t close the game!”
				</p>
				<p>
					Another goal of today’s lesson is to make certain you are engaging in positive self-talk especially when not performing well or after mistakes.

					The first step in today’s lesson is to define your personal hot
					buttons. When are you most likely to become negative, beat yourself
					up, or engage in negative self-talk? Your personal hot buttons will be
					different from another athlete. I can help you improve your self-talk
					by giving you examples based on the most common situations I encounter
					in my work with athletes.
				</p>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Below a typical situations where negative self talk can occur:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><mark>Getting off to a slow start in game performance.</mark></li>
					<li><mark>After making wanted to mistakes in a row.</li>
					<li><mark>Not performing up to your own expectations.</li>
					<li><mark>Thinking... Here I go again... Performing poorly.</li>
					<li><mark>Losing a point of getting beat when you should've won.</li>
					<li><mark>Needing to come through the crunch time to win a game.</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<p>
					Below in Table 8, your task is to list your top five “hot buttons” in
					your sport and your typical reaction to each one. For example, many of
					my golf students can’t stand three-putting. This can lead to negative
					self-talk and self-criticism. A golfer might call himself names after
					three putting such as, “You are a loser. You are the worst putter in
					the world!” This can lead to frustration, trying harder, or an
					avoidance mindset later in the game – “Don’t three putt again,
					stupid.”
				</p>

				<p>Step 2 is to develop a mental strategy for each scenario in which you beat yourself up or engage in negative self-talk. Here is the catch… I want you to pretend you are the most positive coach you know. What would you say to yourself? Using the golf example above:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Old reaction</strong> – I tell myself I am the worst player in the world.
					</li>
					<li><strong>New Reaction</strong> - I tell myself I am a good putter, and if I stay patient and focus on the task, good things will happen.</li>
				</ul>

					You either strive for success will strive to avoid failure and pain,

					athlete and worries too much about making mistakes. If you do this,
					you play to carefully or cautiously. In this mindset, you're trying
					not to lose and try not to make mistakes. The golfer tries not to hit
					the ball in the water. The skater avoids falling on her jobs. The
					tennis player avoids missing the overhead volley. And, so forth.

					Fear causes you to focus on what you don’t want to happen. Your

					When performing tentatively, you body does not flow. You cannot

					Today’s lesson is very important especially if you focus too much on
					mistakes and avoiding mistakes when you perform. You just cannot
					perform fearlessly and tension-free in this mindset. Start by
					understanding any times where you become tentative or focus too much
					on what not to do. Today’s exercise is to determine when you perform
					in a defensive mindset. I have included a few examples to help you get
					started. Check off the examples that apply to you…

				<p>
					Next, learn how to focus on what is really important to execution. The
					best way to do this is to set small process goals for each
					competition. These help you focus on what TO DO instead of what not to
					do. I use two types of process goals to help athletes focus on what to
					do:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Performance goals:</strong> goals based on something you can
						measure such as number of rebound, block shops, or fairways hit the
						regulation.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Mental goals:</strong> goals based on your mental game and
						help you focus on one play, shot, or routine at a time, such as
						committing to a plane or visualising your pitch before you start the
						wind up.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					For more specific information on process goals and concentration
					exercises please refer to the
					<a href="/series/focused/" target="_blank">focused athlete</a> section
					below are a few examples of process goals.

					One note here… I only use process goals to help you become immersed in execution – in the present moment. Although it’s rewarding to reach your goals, I don’t want you to evaluate or judge whether you’re on track to reach them. If you do this, you are not focusing on the process – you are turning them into expectations. Goals become expectations when you judge and criticize yourself for not reaching your goals.

					It is very common for perfectionistic athletes to worry too much about
					what others think of them. They seek social approval from others. They
					want to be admired, accepted, respected or liked by others. To some
					degree, this is normal because we are social beings who want to be
					liked by others.
				</p>
				<p>
					Athletes who crave approval from others often become anxious or are
					afraid to fail in competition. They worry about public embarrassment.
					Perfectionists rely too much on what they think others think about
					them to boost their own feelings of self-worth. They associate
					self-worth with achievement in sports.
				</p>
				<p>
					Perfectionistic athletes think they may lose approval from others by
					playing poorly or making mistakes. This worry supports an athlete’s
					fear of failure. Athletes are afraid to fail because they believe that
					there is potential for embarrassment, loss of respect, or not being
					liked by others!
				</p>
				<p>
					Worrying too much about what others may think encourages a process I
					call “mind reading.” Mind reading is when you make assumptions about
					what others might be thinking about you. When you are trying to read
					others’ minds, you try to avoid embarrassment.

					The goal of today’s lesson is to free you of the need for social
					approval, and thus free yourself from the fear. I want you to stop
					mind reading and making unfounded assumptions about what others might
					think. You most likely want the approval of other people so you can
					feel good about yourself as a person. You might use sports as an
					avenue to boost your feeling of self-worth and it sometimes backfires
					(when you don’t think you are getting it) due to failure or not being
					perfect in this case.
				</p>
				<p>
					We start by defining your self-concept outside of sports. To help you
					with this, you should use the “Defining Your Self Concept” Worksheet I
					provide in Appendix 1. In this exercise, you want to:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Select the top 12 traits that describe your personal characteristics
						- beyond yourself as an athlete or without regard to your level of
						success. In other words, who is the person when not playing sports?
					</li>
					<li>
						Ask two or three other people to complete this assignment
						individually based on what they know about you.
					</li>
					<li>
						Use the results to help you develop a strong sense of self-concept
						that is based on your personal characteristics (not on your
						achievements).
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<strong>Self-Esteem Should Not Be Based on Performance.</strong> Your
					self-esteem should not change based on what you assume others think
					about you or your success:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Use the results of “defining your self-concept” exercise completed
						in task 1 to help you.
					</li>
					<li>
						The next step is to assess your self-concept. Do you like what you
						see with the results of this self-test? In other words, do you like
						who you are? This step is called an assessment of self-concept, and
						it’s related to self-esteem.
					</li>
					<li>
						Your goal is to remember who you are no matter how you perform –
						refer back to the 12 personal characteristics you identified in step
						1.
					</li>
					<li>
						Finally, be clear that no matter how well or poorly you perform,
						people in your life do not change their opinions of who you are as a
						person! The people who matter most to you (e.g. true friends,
						family) will support you and their opinion of you is not based upon
						your achievements (or lack thereof) in sports.
					</li>
					<li>
						You must have personal self-acceptance. Meaning you should accept
						yourself no matter how well or poorly you perform in sports. Then it
						will not matter what others think about how successful you are in
						sports.
					</li>

					During mental toughness training, I teach my students about two mindsets that contribute to success in sports. The first is the training or practice mindset. Great athletes know the value of training. They strive to get better and to improve. They have a tremendous amount of motivation and work ethic, which help them to practice hard so they can master their skills.
				</p>
				<p>
					The trusting or performance mindset is equally important for success in sports. Trust is your ability to let your skills “happen” instinctively by relying on your practice instead of consciously directing your movements. The performance mindset is the ability to rely on your practice, perform freely, and allow your skills to flow without excess thought.
				</p>
				<p>
					The bottom line… If you are stuck in the practice mentality when you compete, you will limit your ability to perform your best because of too much analysis, trying to hard to be perfect, and a loss of trust.

					The first step is to understand how fear of failure and perfectionism
					sabotages your ability to perform freely (and fearlessly) in
					competition. Let’s start with a definition. The performance mindset
					(trust) is your ability to let go of consciously directing your body
					and allowing your well-learned physical skills to happen reflexively
					based on what you have practiced.
				</p>
				<p>
					The concept of trust is different from self-confidence. Confidence is
					a belief in your ability that helps you play well in competition.
					Trust in your skills and your abilities. Fear of failure can undermine
					trust in many ways:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Perfectionists are mentally trapped in a practice mindset and thus
						have a hard time performing involuntarily in competition.
					</li>
					<li>
						Perfectionists are afraid to fail and avoid making mistakes at all
						costs even resorting to playing too carefully.
					</li>
					<li>
						Performing too carefully or defensively leads you to over-control
						your performance or technique; a lack of trust.
					</li>
					<li>
						Since perfectionists think they need to perform their best, you
						might try too hard to be perfect with your game or performance.
					</li>
					<li>
						The fear of making mistakes or disappointing others (fear of
						negative social scrutiny) also leads you to lose trust and not
						perform freely in competition.
					</li>
					<li>
						Thus, fear of failure leads to trying to be perfect. Trying to be
						perfect causes over-control. Over-control leads to a lack of trust
						with your performance.
					</li>
					<li>
						The cycle continues as you analyze what went wrong, work harder at
						fixing the errors, and then getting even more fixated in the
						training mindset.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					Are you able to let it happen in competition? Are you stuck in the
					game of mastering your mechanics or technique and can’t play
					fearlessly in competition? Let’s find out! Table 13 identifies the gap
					between the practice and performance mindsets. Place an X on the
					dotted line below, sliding it to the left or right based upon which
					mentality (training or trusting) is most applicable to you in
					competition.

					Perfectionistic or super motivated athletes who love to train are the
					athletes who have trouble trusting their technique and performing
					fearlessly in competition. Perfectionists strive to look good on the
					playing fields. They want their performance to feel correct, technique
					to look good, and also get the correct results when they perform.
				</p>
				<p>
					Focusing too much on technique, looking good, or feeling correct
					prevents perfectionists from focusing on the real objective in sports
					– to win or get the job done efficiently as possible. When you are
					worried about how your game looks/feels or desire to obtain perfect
					results, it is hard to play with freedom and a quiet mind.
				</p>
				<p>
					I teach my students how to let go of the trying mindset and get into
					the flow mindset in competition by separating the practice athlete
					from the performer. This is the only way to find out if your technique
					is good enough.

					You probably spend too much time in a practice or training mindset as
					discussed in the previous lesson. Therefore, one of your priorities is
					to learn how to stay confident and in control of yourself when your
					performance is not perfect or when you do not have your A game. An
					important lesson I teach my students is to learn how to perform
					efficiently instead of perfectly. I call this a “functional mindset.”
				</p>
				<p>
					A functional mindset is the opposite of trying to make everything
					perfect. It starts with the idea that you <mark>DO NOT</mark> have to
					functional mindset “winning ugly,” which he wrote a book about.
				</p>
				<p>
					In golf, for example, winning ugly is called scrambling. A golfer
					finds a way to get the ball in the hole without regard for “the proper
					way.” In today’s lesson, you will learn how to adopt the functional
					mindset so you can play efficiently and get the job done in

					The following are the top six strategies to helping you perform in a
					functional mindset and win ugly.
				</p>
				<p></p>
				<h4></h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong
							>Strive for perfection in practice, but accept that you cannot be
							perfect with your performance.</strong
						>
						It’s irrational to think you can be perfect with your performance.
						You can strive for perfection in your practice, but you have to
						accept errors as a natural part of sports, and part of being human.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong
							>Give yourself permission to make errors when performing.</strong
						>
						I don’t want you to expect that you will make errors, but you
						certainly must accept them when you commit errors. Give yourself the
						luxury of making 3-4 errors for each performance so you can play on
						in a functional mindset.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Perform efficiently instead of perfectly.</strong> This
						means that you have to abandon the “correct” way to perform in some
						cases. Use whatever works to help you get the job done in
						competition. For example, instead of needing to execute a play
						exactly from the playbook, be happy with a play that worked well,
						but maybe was not “textbook” execution.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Simplify how you perform.</strong> This is the opposite of
						trying to be perfect. Simplicity means using fewer thoughts to
						perform, reacting more, and NOT thinking about every single
						instruction your coach has told you. Don’t “overcoach” yourself, in
						other words. Less is always better.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Perform a task that you know you can perform well.</strong>
						Stick to your “bread and butter” play, shot, or routine. For
						example, I teach my golf students to play the shot that’s currently
						working well instead of the fancy or perfect shot.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Save practice for after the competition.</strong> Avoid
						analyzing your mistakes and trying to fix or correct your technique
						in the middle of a game or performance.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					Using Table 15 below, your task is to devise a sports-specific plan
					for how to put your new functional mindset into action. For example,
					in a functional mindset where mistakes are only temporary road blocks,
					your plan could be to give yourself the luxury of making 3 mistakes
					for each competition.

					Many athletes “train” all year around. In some sports, such as
					skating, an athlete will spend months of training for one major
					competition of the year. Skaters spend 95% of practice time in the
					training mindset. As discussed in previous lessons, too much of just
					the training mindset makes it difficult to transition into the
					performance mindset when competition time comes around.
				</p>
				<p>
					In other sports like golf, perfectionists can become enamored with
					their golf swing or technique. They spend most of their practice time
					on the practice tee working to improve mechanics of the swing and very
					little time playing on the course. This scenario also makes it
					difficult for the golfer to transition to the performer mindset in
					competition. These golfers look like stars in practice, but hackers on
					the course.

					One goal of The Fearless Athlete is to help you perform fearlessly,
					without the mental traps of trying to be perfect or the fear of making

				</p>
				<div class="container">
					<div>
						<div class="container__row container__row-title">
							1. Focus on what you want to have happen

							Taper your “training” as you approach competition so you can get

							2. Know when to train and when to perform
						</div>
						<div class="container__row">

					Up to this point in the workbook, I have discussed how to improve
					trust and perform without fear. In today’s lesson, I want to help you
					understand some important practice strategies that will help you
					easily transition into the fearless performer mindset. As stated,
					perfectionists love to practice and work on weaknesses to the extent
					that practicing can undermine a performance mindset in competition.
					Some athletes are great practice players, but can’t apply their
					practice to competition.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the rules of trust is that you must know the best time to apply
					a training mindset and the best time to apply the performance mindset.
					This means you should also separate your practice into two phases. You
					might dedicate one part of your practice to improving your technique,
					mechanics, method, or working on drills.
				</p>
				<p>
					This helps you transition away from the training mindset into the
					performance mindset. For example, gymnasts do what is called “pressure
					sets” to help them match what happens in meets. Gymnasts use pressure
					sets to simulate the competitive environment when they practice so
					they can feel the same pressure of competition – or at least closer to
					what they will feel in competition. You do not have to use every
					second of practice to do drills to improve technique.
				</p>
				<p>
					A misconception about practice is that you always have to be working
					on technique and mastering perfect mechanics. Your practices should
					include “performing” as well as drilling or training your technique.
					You need to put everything together into a whole performance. For
					example, basketball coaches will structure practice to work on drills
					for lay ups, free-throw technique, dribbling, passing, and defending.
					However, coaches also schedule scrimmages to allow athletes to apply
					the drill work to play. This is why football and basketball teams
					spend a lot of time scrimmaging and not just doing drills.

					When I discuss balance with my students I use a simple, but important
					motto: “Leave sports on the playing field after you leave the arena.”
					Can you forget about your performance after you leave the playing
					field, court, track, or course? Do you get so frustrated when you
					perform poorly that you take the feeling of disappointment home with
					you? And the very next day you are back at practice and think you need
					to give more effort and practice harder? Finally, does how well you
					play on a given day determine how you feel about yourself after you go
					home? Are you upset for a long time or can you leave it on the playing
					field?
				</p>
				<p>
					Athletes who care deeply about sports success and who spend a lot of
					time in practice or training, such as golfers, skaters, swimmers, and
					gymnasts, for example, often wrongly define themselves through their
					sport. They believe that their level of success (as an athlete)
					defines them as a person. These athletes live and die with every
					performance. After a poor performance, they feel like a failure.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you win or perform well, do you feel better about yourself as a
					person? And if you lose or perform poorly, do you get upset,
					frustrated, and can’t stand to look into the mirror when you get home?
					Sadly I hear these statements a lot!
				</p>
				<p>
					If you train all day long, every day or take a 24/7 approach to your
					sport training, you might be the type of athlete who defines yourself
					through sports.

					The first step to creating balance in your life is to understand that
					you are person and not just an athlete. You are not an “athlete” who
					happens also to be a person. You also happen to play sports. This can
					be a revelation for many athletes who are used to defining themselves
					as an athlete.
				</p>
				<p>
					Let’s begin by defining the other “roles” in your life (other pursuits
					and areas of your life beyond sports). Your other roles can include
					student, businessperson, son or daughter, friend, wife or husband,
					father or mother, hobbyist, and so on. What are the other roles you
					have in your life? List at least five below.

				<p>
					If your life is all about sport, you are at greater risk for
					self-esteem problems because you define yourself based on your level
					of success in sports and can’t separate the different roles in your
					life. You goal is to strive to find a balance in your life with
					family, school, sports, friends, hobbies, and other career
					aspirations.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<strong>Become a Magician at "Role Playing"</strong> When you are
						playing tennis, involve yourself in that role - ccommit to 8 hours
						of practice or playing a day if thats what it takes, but when you
						leave the tennis court, switch roles and fully commit to other areas
						of your life. Dont superimpose the role of athlete onto other areas
						of life.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Define Your Self-Concept Outside of Sports</strong> To help
						you become a magician at changing roles, you must first define whou
						you are outside tennis(use appendix 1 to help you with this task.)
						Use only descriptions that apply to your personal characteristics
						that you bring to every aspect of your life. Make a list of these
						positive characteristics and review them every day. Know who the
						person inside is!
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Dont take it home with you.</strong> Leave tennis on the
						court. I know this one will be hard to do. At the very least,
						designate one or two hours of family or recreation time. Everyone
						needs a break. Leaving it on the court is especially important when
						you did not perform up to your ability. In addition, your family
						will appreciate you if you dont bring home the negative emotions.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>For Balance in your life.</strong> Success is what you
						define it to be. When I see athletes who have 24/7 involvement in
						their sport, I suggest that they find other hobbies, interests, or
						goals to occupy their time when not performing or practicing. Have
						you considered any hobbies that you were afraid to start because of
						the time demands of your sport? Do you have other career interests
						that you could spend a couple hours a week pursuing?
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong
							>List at least five other recreational activities, family
							gatherings, educational endeavors or career pursuits</strong

					<h2>Congratulations!</h2> Way to go! You should pat yourself on
					the back for completing The Fearless Athlete program. The new,
					fearless you is on your way to unbeatable trust. You should be proud
					of yourself for taking action with your mental game and recognizing
					that you can improve your attitude and mental toughness. You will be
					rewarded for taking action to improve your mental game! Now for the
					real fun part…
				</p>
				<p>
					I need you to take fearless action now! You are armed with the
					powerful mental strategies and tools to help you remove fear, focus on
					success, and improve your trust, which is an excellent first step!
					But, this is just the beginning to rocket you to unbeatable trust! THE
					most important objective is to use the lessons in this workbook and CD
					program and apply them daily to your practice and play! This is
					critical to achieving peak performance…
				</p>
				<p>
					I make sure all my students understand that learning any skills,
					especially mental game skills, requires three steps. The first part is
					the ability to understand the mental strategies that will help improve
					your mental game. The second stage is the ability to apply your mental
					strategies to your sport daily. The third and final stage is your
					ability to commit, over the long term – months and months, to improve
					your trust, confidence, and mental attitude. Learning is never
					complete without the diligence to stay committed to your mental
					training program.
				</p>
				<p>
					My suggestion is to review The Fearless Athlete at least once a month
					and more often if necessary. Use the “Assess Your Progress” sections
					at the end of each session to help you identify areas to improve and
					track your progress. On the following page, I have included a summary
					of the action plans for each day of the 14-day program that will help

					A 14-Day Plan for Superior Concentration
				</h3>

				<p>
					Welcome to The Focused Athlete: A 14-day Plan for Superior
					Concentration. Next to self-confidence, the ability to focus is
					critical for peak performance in sports. World championship athletes
					know how to harness the power of a zone focus and I want to teach you
					how to do the same. I am contacted regularly by many athletes who
					either want to improve their confidence or have trouble focusing on
					the playing fields. Since focus is so important to your success and
					reaching peak performance, I have decided that the second workbook in
					our “Confident Athlete Series” needs to be “The Focused Athlete”.
				</p>
				<p>
					The focused athlete teaches everything I share when working with my
					individual mental coaching students. At the end of this program, you
					will have learned the key concentration skills so you can achieve a
					zone focus for peak performance in your sport. In “The Focused
					Athlete” I provide you with a system to understand: what to focus on,
					how to focus on what is important, and how to deal with common
					distractions that all athletes must learn to overcome in order to be
					successful.
				</p>
				<p></p>
				<blockquote>
					“I think the key is not to worry about the future or the past, not to
					think about whether you are going to win or lose."<cite
						>~Mary Pierce, 1997 Italian Open</cite
					>
				</blockquote>

				<p>
					Superior concentration occurs when you become totally immersed in a
					task, feel that time is suspended, and lose the sense of being
					separated from your sports environment, (such as when a baseball
					player reports he can see the seams of a baseball traveling at over 90
					MPH). Your goal every time you hit the field, court, or course is to
					have a razor-sharp focus, a mind clear of daily hassles, and the
					ability to focus on what is important in your environment.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most athletes and coaches don’t realize that the most important step
					in developing superior concentration is the ability to REFOCUS when
					you get distracted or offtask. You are human – just like the best
					athletes in the world – and your focus will drift or become confused
					at times. When this happens, it doesn’t mean that you lack the skills
					to be a great athlete, rather that you need to learn how to refocus to
					excel. As I teach all of my students, I remind them that the first
					step to learning to overcome an issue is to recognize when it starts.
					To refocus, you must be able to recognize when your mind has drifted
					from the task, make an adjustment, and get on with focusing on the
					task-relevant information.
				</p>
				<p>
					Over the last 15 or so years of working with athletes from all sports
					and all levels, I have learned that you must work at improving
					concentration just as an athlete works at developing a perfect jump
					shot in basketball. You must also understand how to enhance
					concentration by coping with the mental gremlins that disrupt
					concentration. The Focused Athlete teaches you both how to harness
					superior concentration to get you into a zone focus for peak
					performance AND how to fend off distractions and other non-important
					information that disrupts a zone focus.
				</p><h3>How to use this program</h3>

				<p>
					Each day you will be given specific tasks to complete to work on your
					concentration. At the end of 14 days, you should be on your way to
					superior concentration. Every day of the program is divided into daily
					tasks for you to complete. To get the best focus from each daily focus
					boost, you should complete all the tasks in each day.
				</p>

				<p>
					Use the audio program that came with The Focused Athlete to help guide
					you through your concentration program. Listen to the audio for Day 1
					and then complete the workbook exercises before proceeding to Day 2
					audio.
				</p>
				<p>
					Table 1, below, is a description of the daily tasks you will complete
					in each section to enhance your focus.

					The pinnacle of a focused state of mind in sports is what we call
					being in “the zone.” What is the zone or a zone focus? Some athletes
					describe this state of awareness as flow, in a cocoon, or in a bubble.
					Regardless of how you describe the zone, it’s simply a state of total
					involvement in the task that you are performing in the present moment.
					We don’t need to make this complicated – it’s what you choose to
					attend to in your environment. And this changes from sport to sport
					and task to task within each sport.
				</p>
				<p>
					My definition of focus is the ability to concentrate or pay attention
					to relevant tasks in the present moment without getting pulled off
					task by internal or external distractions (Later, I will define these
					two types of distractions). One note before I go any further, I use
					the words “focus” and “concentration” interchangeably.
				</p>
				<p>
					Total concentration occurs when you become absorbed in the moment or
					task, lose track of time, and lose a sense of being separate from your
					sports experience. I know this sounds a little Zen like, but this
					ideal state is what I want you to understand, adopt and apply in your
					sport.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition, concentration is an ability to not attend to distractions
					or taskirrelevant cues that will upset your focus from the main
					objective of performing your best!
				</p>
				<p>
					Thus, in summary, concentration or focus includes the following
					elements:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Your ability to identify what’s relevant to focus on for peak
						performance in your sport
					</li>
					<li>
						Your ability to only focus on what is important to attend to for
						each task
					</li>
					<li>
						Your ability to stay focused in the present moment – or immersed
					</li>
					<li>
						Your ability to insulate yourself from distractions and an ability
						to refocus when you become distracted
					</li>

					Every single athlete has the ability to concentrate, but sometimes
					what they focus on gets displaced or they think about the wrong stuff
					at the wrong time. Concentration can suffer from both internal and
					external distractions and can come in many forms from subtle to not so
					subtle. You must first identify your distractions during practice and
					competition.
				</p>
				<p>
					What are internal and external distractions? The most common
					distractions are called “internal distractions.” These are
					self-induced disruptions in concentration that enter your mind in the
					form of doubt, indecision, lack of confidence, or thoughts about past
					events or future outcomes. Your own thinking, and not the environment
					or other people, triggers internal distractions.
				</p>
				<p>
					The environment or what is going on outside your mind triggers
					external distractions. Some examples include people in the stands,
					harsh weather conditions, or an opponent that is trying to psych you
					out. External distractions start outside you, but can turn into
					internal distractions if not filtered correctly.
				</p>
				<p>
					No matter what type of distraction, it will break your concentration
					and cause you to make errors. Understanding your potential
					concentration breakdowns – so you can recognize them sooner – is one
					of the important keys to superior concentration. You are not perfect
					and thus neither is your ability to stay focused 100% of the time.
					This means that you will need to adjust your concentration.

					Every person who plays sports has the ability to concentrate – you
					would not be able to throw a ball to a target or hit a golf shot
					unless you were able to focus your attention for a few seconds on an
					object, feeling, or target. We would go crazy if we did not have the
					ability to selectively attend to certain thoughts or perceptual cues
					in the environment. Every athlete has the power to selectively attend
					to certain performance “cues” and that gives you the ability to
					concentrate, by choosing what you focus on during your performance.
				</p>
				<p>
					The mind works in a way to filter out what is necessary to focus on
					and what is not necessary to focus on in order to throw a baseball or
					hit a slap shot. I call these “task-relevant performance cues” because
					they are the important things you need to focus on for successful
					execution of any motor task.
				</p>
				<p>
					The next step in this program is to identify the performance cues or
					task-cues that you must CHOOSE to attend to so you can perform your
					best. However, we must keep in mind that the important cues for each
					sport will change depending on what task you are engaged in. For
					example, a golfer must focus on a different set of performance cues
					when preparing to hit a drive, compared to hitting a putt. When I talk
					about task-relevant performance cues, there are many different types
					of “cues” you may need to attend to, such cues as thoughts, feelings,
					communication from teammates, targets, and cues from your
					surroundings, just to mention a few. (So keep a broad mind here when I
					discuss cues).

					The first step is to identify the certain tasks you perform in your
					sport. Then we can begin to set forth the performance cues that are
					important for you. This is a simple step that requires you to think
					about the skills you perform on a regular basis. If you only perform
					one skill like shooting, it makes your job even easier. However, in
					some sports, such as gymnastics and golf, you perform several
					different routines or different skills.
				</p>

				<h4>Examples of Skills Performed in Golf:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Hitting a tee shot/ full shot from the fairway to the green</li>
					<li>Chipping a ball onto a green</li>
					<li>Putting ball into a hole</li>
					<li>Hitting a fairway bunker shot</li>
					<li>Hitting a green-side bunker shot</li>
					<li>Playing a specialty shot</li>

					The second step is to break these skills down into performance cues.
					Each skill or set of skills will require their own special performance
					cues for successful execution. There will be some overlap between
					skills too. Your coach should be able to give you some guidance with
					this task.

					I will use a golf example to highlight the changes to the important

				<p>
					If you play golf, keep in mind you will need to define the cues for
					the other skills you perform too, including sand play, chipping,
					driving, and specialty shots. Hint: These performance cues are part of
					your normal preshot routine.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now it is your turn. Divide your sport up into skills or sub skills.
					For example in tennis, you would have service, return of serve,
					baseline rally, net volley, and overhead.

					The next step is to define the thoughts, feelings, and environmental
					cues that are not important (also called task-irrelevant cues that
					have no relevance to your performance). You need to be able to
					distinguish between what is important to focus on for execution and
					what is just a distraction to your performance. The list of
					non-relevant information is much longer than what is relevant to your
					performance.
				</p>
				<p>
					Irrelevant information in the form of internal or external
					distractions can cloud your focus and prevent you from focusing on the
					task at hand. If irrelevant cues or distractions go unchecked in your
					mind, your concentration and performance will suffer. Before you
					realize it, a small distraction can cause you to miss an important
					free throw or miss an easy putt, for example, if you are trying to hit
					a putt and you have a thought related to what you need to do after the
					round pops into your head.
				</p>
				<p>
					What are task-irrelevant cues or thoughts? As an athlete, your mind is
					bombarded with a multitude of thoughts, feelings, emotions, and
					external information in which you have to filter and attend to the
					important stuff. For example, thinking about what you will do after
					the hockey game has no bearing on the current play you are running in
					the game. Thus, it’s not important, nor relevant to helping you
					execute a play.

					overload their brains with too much information – more than they can

					Information overload or having misleading information sends mixed

					execute with the desired outcome or rhythm. Once you define

					The goal of becoming fully immersed into your sport or performing a

					discussed. One way we can accomplish immersion in the task is to have
					you perform a short, guided, mental rehearsal task.
				</p>
				<h4>Here is your task:</h4>
				<p>
					Find a quiet area where you will not be distracted. Close your eyes
					and experience yourself at your favorite place such as a beach,
					meadow, stream, forest, mountain or ocean. This place should be
					special to you, as well as peaceful and joyous. Now, I want you to
					take in the environment, noticing everything you can about your
					surroundings, such as sights, feelings, sounds, smells, and tastes, or
					any other information that comes to mind. Just observe your
					environment and what you are feeling right now. In your mind, become
					fully immersed into this experience of observing your favorite place.
				</p>
				<p>
					Your mission is to stay immersed into absorbing and noticing your
					surroundings without getting distracted by irrelevant thoughts. If a
					distraction does enter your mind, let it pass and get back to
					experiencing your favorite place and noticing your surrounding.
				</p>
				<p>
					If this task was easy for you to do without any internal distractions,
					then you have the ability to become immersed into your sports tasks.
					Practice this skill often if you had trouble focusing on your favorite
					place without distractions. You will find that the more you practice,
					the easier it will get to become fully immersed in your sports tasks.

					As we discussed in the last lesson, the goal is to become fully
					immersed into your performance cues so that distracting thoughts do
					not have power to penetrate your focus. If you think of your attention
					as having a limited amount of space – in terms of what you can focus
					on at one time – with only enough capacity for what you want and need
					to focus on, it does not allow room for distractions to penetrate.
					However, this is the ideal state and not always the case when you are
					in a boring practice session or playing in a big game and under
					pressure. Thus, it is critical for you to learn how to refocus when
					you do have a distraction – and the first step is awareness.
				</p>
				<p>
					Great athletes have enough awareness to know when they are in focus or
					slightly unfocused. Awareness is simply the ability to recognize when
					you are not focused, when the mind wanders, or when your mind is too
					active to concentrate. Therefore, the very first step in helping you
					get back on track after your mind strays is to catch yourself before
					you slip or make an error.

					Awareness can be both good and bad in sports. If you are too aware of
					your surroundings during a game to the point that your environment
					distracts you (i.e. a fan in the stands that is yelling), then you
					will not have total focus on your performance. However, for this daily
					concentration boost, I want you to have the awareness of the triggers
					that distract you, so you can stop what you are thinking about, and be
					able to make an adjustment.
				</p>
				<p>
					The previous 2 sections should help you do this because you now know
					what you should and should not attend to when competing. This
					heightens your awareness of the wrong thoughts or cues to think about
					during practice or performance.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most athletes have specific distractions they must deal with daily. I
					call these typical distractions. In addition, these distractions are
					triggered by some external “event” that happens to you when you are
					performing. A classic example is when you feel you got a bad call from
					an official. This can turn into an internal distraction, because you
					start to dwell on it and maybe even feel frustrated that you were on
					the end of a bad call, but this is something that is out of your
					control.
				</p>
				<p>
					Your task in Table 9 below is to identify the most common external
					events that trigger distractions during a game situation. When you are
					aware of the triggers, you once again have a better chance to
					recognize that you need to make an adjustment mentally. In the table
					below you will find some examples to help you get started:

					My formula for superior focus - and regaining your focus when it’s
					lost - comes together in today’s lesson as we begin to put all the
					previous lessons to work with a strategy called the “3 R’s for
					Refocusing.” The Three R’s are: Recognize, Regroup and Refocus.
				</p>
				<h4>A Simple 3 Step Method for Refocusing After Distractions:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Recognize</strong> — awareness that you are not on task or
						distracted.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Regroup</strong> — ability to break the current distraction
						or thought.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Refocus</strong> — to get back on the performance cues for
						the next play or shot.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The three R’s are designed to help you regain your focus as quickly as
					possible after a distraction. The moment you notice that you are
					off-task, it is highly important to regain concentration by having the
					ability to pull your focus back to your performance cues or to get
					back in the present.
				</p>
				<p>
					This entire process should not be lengthy and take no more than 2-4
					seconds to complete quickly “on the fly.” With some self-paced tasks
					such as a golf shot, tennis serve, or free throw in basketball, I
					recommend to students that they stop and restart their routine over if
					they get distracted at the wrong time.
				</p>
				<p>
					This may not be possible in some sports with continuous action, like
					hockey or basketball in which you are reacting to an opponent. That’s
					why you should quickly try and refocus on the fly. You have to learn
					to quickly recognize distractions and equally as fast, get your head
					back into the task.
				</p>`

					“I have always just had good focus. I think the ability to focus
					definitely separates players – the players that are able to focus on
					the task at hand and ignore everything else that goes on will do
					better than those who get distracted in big moments during the
					game.”<cite>~Michelle Akers, USA World Cup Soccer Team</cite>

							section: 'Daily Focus Boost',
							id: 'boost',
							content: `<p>
					The first R in the Three R’s deals with awareness, which I discussed
					in lesson 6. The second R (Regroup) is the transition between
					awareness (“I am not focused”) to action (“I need to get my head in
					the game”). The third R is the most important step, because this is
					how you will immerse yourself into your performance after a short
					brain fade.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am not talking about brain surgery here – Recognize – Regroup – and
					Refocus. What are some ways you can regroup so you can begin to
					refocus?
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>“STOP! – that thought is not relevant.”</li>
					<li>“GET BACK – this is not important.”</li>
					<li>“Get your head in the game!”</li>
					<li>“Stop dwelling in the past!”</li>
					<li>“Forget about the future!”</li>
					<li>“I control my own thoughts and focus.”</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					I think you get the idea above. You want to use a short statement to
					zap you into the present moment as a way of getting you ready to
					re-engage with your performance cues. Here is a good question you can
					ask yourself to help you with the final and most important R
					(Refocus): “What do I need to focus on right now to execute this play,
					shot, or routine?” You might also use a physical cue to mentally
					trigger yourself to refocus. Many athletes use physical triggers to
					start an at-bat routine for example, or to get refocused as well, such
					as tapping the bat on the plate at the start of an at-bat. Another
					example is when a golfer tightens her golf glove, which is symbolic to
					tightening her focus for the shot.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is time for your daily exercise. Using the Triggers from Table 10
					in the last session, I want you to develop a specific strategy to help
					you refocus on the task, by applying the three R’s. The purpose of
					this is to be prepared for any distraction and to have a strategy in
					place that you pre-planned. I have given one example in the table
					below to help you get started.

					The difficultly in writing a workbook that pertains to all sports is
					that I have to write broadly enough to cover many sports and sports
					skills. The purpose of Day 8 is to give you specific strategies for
					refocusing and concentrating your best, related to self-paced and
					continuous type sports. I cannot cover all sports here, but I can give
					you some advice on how to refocus for skills that are similar to the
					ones you perform.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some sports are very fast paced (hockey, soccer, auto racing,
					racquetball) and require you to refocus quickly or you might lose the
					game, match, or race, or at least, compound an error. Other sports
					such as bowling, golf, and baseball, are not fast paced and give you
					time to refocus because of a natural stop-and-go action that happens
					between shots or pitches. These sports are called self-paced tasks
					because the action is paced by the performer, not by another player or
					response to a specific action (e.g. starting gun, whistle, tip off,
					etc).
				</p>
				<p>
					In fast paced sports that do not have natural breaks in the play, but
					instead have a continual action, the task of refocusing is both more
					critical and harder to do at the same time. However, in self-paced
					sports, you have a lot of time to process your next or last shot and
					use The Three R’s prior to execution.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition, most self-paced sports skills allow you the opportunity
					to stop your preshot, pre-pitch, or pre-service routine and start over
					or restart the routine from an earlier point in the routine. You want
					to make sure you are completely ready to hit a shot, serve or throw
					the pitch before you execute.

					“What works well for gymnasts, especially on the beam, is mental cues.

					and it never changes.”<cite

					Let’s start with self-paced sports tasks that are performed in golf,
					tennis, bowling, free-throws, penalty kicks, and any other tasks you
					control when the action starts. If you play these sports or another
					self-paced task, you have the luxury to not begin the serve or shot
					until you are completely focused and ready (within the rules of the
					game of course). If you can learn how to use the extra time to refine
					your focus you’ll find it an asset. However, if you spend your time
					unwisely by investing it into over-analyzing or over-thinking the
					performance, you won’t perform your best.”
				</p>
				<p>
					With sports that have non-stop action or are continuous (none or very
					little breaks in action) such as auto racing, hockey, swimming,
					running, or soccer, you can lose precious seconds with just one
					distraction. One simple mental slip caused by a distraction in a race
					car can cause you to wreck the car or lose valuable seconds from lap
					times. Continuous-action sports require that you are completely
					focused during competition. And if you do become distracted, you must
					learn to refocus very quickly – your life may literally depend on it!
				</p>
				<h4>
					With self-paced sports or tasks, you have two options for refocusing:
				</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Restart your routine</li>
					<li>Refocus quickly “on the fly”</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>
					With continuous-action sports, in most cases, you only have one option
					for refocusing:
				</h4>
				<p>Refocus quickly “on the fly”, or in real-time</p>
				<p>
					Let’s see how both refocusing strategies work using specific examples.
					You will need to make the application to your sport based on the
					examples below:
				</p>
				<h4>Refocus Routine for Self-Paced task (Basketball Free Throw)</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<strong>Recognize – </strong>You sight someone behind the basket
						trying to distract you on purpose while you are about to hit the
						shot.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Regroup – </strong>say to yourself “Stop – wrong thing to
						focus on.” You decide to restart your preshot routine from the ball
						bounce.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Refocus – </strong>You re-engage with your preshot routine
						from the ball bounce and stay focused on the target only.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>Refocus Routine for Continuous Sports (Triathlon)</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<strong>Recognize – </strong>In the mass start, your swim goggles
						get knocked off or hit so they are flooded with water inside.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Regroup – </strong>Focus on moving to the outside, where you
						can put them back on or get the water out of your eyes.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Refocus – </strong>Focus on getting back into a rhythm with
						your swim stroke. It’s a long race, you can get the time back on the
						bike or run.

					How often do you go into a game unable to forget about an argument you
					had with a best friend or preoccupied with the exam you will be taking
					the next day? For some athletes, they bring life’s challenges and
					hassles with them when they enter the sports arena. One goal of this
					program is to help you enter the role of the focused athlete.
				</p>
				<p>
					I teach my students to suspend their life outside of sports so they
					can focus completely on their performance – if only for 2 hours at a
					time. When you step onto the arena or practice facility, you must
					assume the role of athlete, the focused athlete. However, this does
					not mean you are ignoring real-life issues and challenges you are
					faced with at the time. Entering your role as athlete only means that
					you switch mental gears and now give yourself permission to focus on
					your sport without the mental handcuffs that you may otherwise bring
					into competition.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can enter the role of the athlete by leaving life’s distractions
					in the parking lot and allowing yourself to be selfish for a couple
					hours. For example, to turn “off” life distractions and concentrate on
					your sport, write a task list of what you have to do after
					competition, (such as a school paper) then make a commitment to
					yourself to leave the list in the parking lot, your locker, or hotel
					room. After competition you can go back to your task list and do not
					need to worry about it during play.

					<li>
						Having an unresolved issue in your life that causes emotional pain
						such as a divorce.
					</li>
					<li>Being preoccupied with finance issues in your life.</li>
					<li>Worrying about a sick child or another family member at home.</li>
					<li>Dwelling about sponsors not signing you for a new season.</li>

					Professional athletes use specific pregame rituals or routines to
					instill a winning mindset, and you should too. The ultimate goal of
					your pregame routine is to create a mindset that lets you perform up
					to your full potential! Consistent mental preparation leads to
					consistent performance - the hallmark of champion athletes. Your
					pregame warm up is an excellent time to integrate your focusing
					strategies.
				</p>
				<p>
					Think of the pregame routine as your final mental tune-up prior to
					competition. It has four important purposes: (1) to get loose and
					physically warm up, (2) to focus the mind, (3) to instill confidence,
					and (4) to help you trust your ability. The pregame routine is also an
					excellent time to transition from life into sport – and assume or
					enter the role of the focused athlete.
				</p>
				<p>
					For more information on pregame routines, please refer my e-book

					Best.” Here is the link to my proshop:

				<ol>
					<li>
						<strong>To be fully focused on execution.</strong> What you focus on
						prior to competition is critical to your mental game success. As we
						have discussed, you must direct your focus in a meaningful way.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>To feel confident in one’s skills.</strong> Confidence is
						the number one objective of your mental preparation. Confidence
						without strict expectations is my formula for success. As you will
						learn, confidence is built in many ways, some sources are practice,
						preparation, game plans and the mindsets you maintain (see “The
						Confident Athlete” CD Program:
						http://www.peaksports.com/proshop.php).
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>To prepare to cope with adversity.</strong> In the corporate
						world, executives are taught to develop a crisis plan before an
						emergency strikes. This allows them to formulate a plan when their
						heads are clear, rather than trying to create a plan out of
						necessity when emotions are running high. Experienced athletes
						create coping mechanisms to deal with different forms of adversity,
						such as situations that could cause them to lose focus, confidence
						or composure. The goal here is to anticipate the challenges that
						might affect your ability to focus your best and develop strategies
						to cope with each situation.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>To fully enter the role of the athlete.</strong> This was
						covered in the last session (lesson 9). I use this phase to help
						athletes make the transition between life and sports.

					One of the best methods I know to help athletes release their thoughts
					about outcomes and focus on the present moment is to give them simple
					process goals (also called mini-goals) to focus their attention to
					important cues during competition. My philosophy is this: Working the
					process brings desired results! This means you must put aside
					outcomes, results, and consequences of your performance and focus on
					the moment-to-moment execution. Ask yourself what you need to do
					moment-by-moment or play-by-play to perform your best.
				</p>
				<p>
					One note here… I only use process goals to help you become immersed in
					the ingredients of the task. Although it’s rewarding to reach your
					goals, I don’t want you to evaluate or judge whether you’re on track
					to reach them. If you do this, you are not focusing on the process.
					The pre-game routine is an excellent time to decide on process goals
					to focus on during competition.
				</p>
				<p>
					I use two types of process goals to help athletes stay in the moment:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Performance Goals:</strong> goals based on something you can
						measure such as, number of rebounds, blocked shots, or fairways hit
						in regulation.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Mental Goals:</strong> goals based on your mental game that
						help you focus on one play, shot, or routine at a time, such as
						committing to a plan or visualizing your pitch before you start the
						wind up.
					</li>

					Each and every performance, your task is to set one or two process
					goals – both performance and mental process goals. In some sports such
					as triathlons, you can set process goals for each stage of the event
					(run, swim & bike). Let me start by giving you some sport specific
					examples of process goals or mini-goals that you can modify for your

					A pre-shot routine is an excellent way to integrate your focusing
					skills into your regular practice and competition. For the purpose of
					this workbook, there are two goals of the pre-shot routine. The first
					is to improve the consistency of your mental preparation in the hopes
					of leading to a more consistent performance. The second purpose is to
					help you focus on performance cues and thus your execution. Preshot
					routines are best applied to self-paced tasks (stop-and-go sports,
					such as bowling) instead of continuous-play sports (such as swimming).
					However, in continuous sports, athletes can also apply routines to
					prepare for the start of a performance, also called pre-performance
					routines, such as a swimmer on the blocks before the start of a race
					or a hockey player starting a new shift.
				</p>
				<p>
					What is most important is having a good mental approach or an
					effective mental routine. The mental routine directly ties into your
					performance cues that you must focus on for successful execution. In
					fact, your performance cues actually comprise the elements of your
					routine.
				</p>
				<h4>A mental pre-shot routine works to help you to:</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Observe and process information.</li>
					<li>Make decisions, set strategies, and develop a plan.</li>
					<li>Program your mind and body to perform well.</li>
					<li>Mentally rehearse the skill you are about to execute.</li>
					<li>Get your mind in an optimal state to execute your best.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					If you neglect one of these areas in your preparation, you fail to
					prepare fully for successful execution. The objective is to train
					yourself to approach each shot or start of your performance with good
					planning, confidence, and focus on performance cues.

					Your task is to develop a pre-shot or pre-performance routine that
					defines the appropriate performance cues for execution. There are 6
					steps in the mental routine you want to follow in order to prepare for
					a shot, kick, swim, or field goal for example. Below is a golf
					specific example:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<strong>Planning:</strong> Select a visual target and the type of
						shot you want to hit. Be specific and commit to the plan.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Image:</strong> See or feel the type of shot you selected in
						the plan. Make it seem as real as possible by feeling the shot or by
						visualizing the shot trajectory. (e.g., hit the green and roll into
						the hole).
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Rehearse:</strong> Use a practice swing to feel the shot you
						want to hit. Focus on balance or the simple feeling of the swing.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Focus:</strong> Stay focused on execution and the visual or
						feel of the shot.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Set up:</strong> Aim the clubface and set your body parallel
						to the left of the clubface.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Trust:</strong> Focus on the target and let the image of the
						target or the feeling of a good swing trigger the swing. No more
						than one swing should be thought about here.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Depending on your sport or the task you are performing, these steps
					will change. For example, for a tennis serve, the steps in the set up
					will differ from the golf example above. In addition, the images you
					use to see or feel successful execution will be specific to your
					learning preferences.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now it’s your turn. Using the table below, include the performance
					cues you must focus on for successful execution.

					You will need 15-20 minutes to complete The Focused Athlete Mental

					not listen to this guided imagery program while driving a car, as it
					is important that you are completely focused on the imagery program,
					plus it’s also important for you to drive safely! The program begins
					with about 5 minutes of relaxation that is followed by the guided
					imagery program, which will take you through a general pre-game
					routine and then part of your actual performance. You will have a
					chance to practice your refocusing skills and review your pregame
					routine.

					Congratulations! You have completed The Focused Athlete. The new,

					be proud of yourself for taking action with your mental game to be the
					most focused athlete you can be, committed to excellence in sports.
					Take a moment to congratulate the efforts you have made so far!
				</p>
				<p>
					I need you to take real action now; MASSIVE action right now. You are
					armed with the information and tools to help you be a focused athlete
					and improve your mental game, which is an excellent first step! But,
					this is just the beginning to rocket your concentration to new
					heights.
				</p>
				<p>
					I inform all my mental coaching students that learning any skills,
					especially mental skills, is a three part process. The first part is
					the ability to understand the mental strategies that will help improve
					your mental game. The second stage is the ability to apply your mental
					strategies to your sport daily. The third and final stage is your
					ability to commit, over the long term – months and months, to improve
					your focus and mental attitude. Your learning is never complete
					without the diligence to stay committed to your mental training
					program.
				</p>
				<p>
					My suggestion is to review The Focused Athlete at least once a month
					and more often if necessary. Use “The Focused Athlete Evaluation”
					after every performance to help you identify areas to improve and
					bring attention to. On the following page, I have included a summary
					of the action plans for each day of the 14-day program that will help
					you take action daily. Remove this page from your workbook and post it
					where you can see it every day. You should review these action plans
					often and work daily to apply 1-2 of the concepts to your practice,
					training, and competition! On the following page, you will find the
					final Taking Focused Action Commitment Contract that you should review
					and sign now. Warning: if you sign the contract, be prepared to take
					massive action!

					A 14-Day Plan for Ultimate Self-Confidence.
				</h3><p>
					Self-confidence is THE NUMBER ONE ASSET that separates great athletes
					from the rest of the pack. Athletes CANNOT reach true athletic
					potential without massive amounts of confidence in their game(s) and
					abilities. Most athletes who seek my services do so because they
					desire to know how to improve confidence; have a “fragile” state of
					confidence; or their confidence has been challenged by a difficult
					experience or encounter.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Confident Athlete represents everything I teach my individual
					students and teams to help them improve and develop massive amounts of
					confidence quickly and maintain it over the long term. I share all of
					my insights, hold nothing back and teach my system for learning
					ultimate self-confidence to any athlete serious about improving his or
					her confidence!
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					“A motto and philosophy that I have really stressed is [SIC];; you’ve
					got to believe in yourself. Self confidence is without a doubt the
					first step to success.”
					<cite>~ Tommy Lasorda, Baseball Manager, Hall of Fame</cite>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Confidence is important for every athlete. However, understanding how
					you can develop confidence daily is the most relevant approach to
					boosting your confidence. What I have learned through working with
					athletes at all levels is that athletes must take responsibility for
					improving confidence just like they work at developing a perfect
					backhand, pitch, swing, stroke and so forth. Athletes must also have a
					clear understanding about the beliefs, thoughts, and expectations that
					consistently undermine confidence.
				</p>
				<p>
					Confidence development is a two part package. In one respect, athletes
					need to focus on their strengths and maintain confident-enhancing
					thoughts about their sport even in the face of adversity. And, in
					another respect, athletes must understand how to identify the beliefs,
					thoughts or expectations that undermine or hold back their confidence.
				</p><h3>How to use this program</h3>
				<p>
					Each day you are given specific tasks to complete to help you build
					confidence. At the end of 14 days, you should be on your way to
					ultimate confidence, but it is important to keep up the strategies I
					share with you far beyond 14 days to gain the most benefit from the
					program.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each day of the 14-day program is divided into sections of various
					tasks which you should complete. To gain the most confidence from each
					daily booster, you should complete all the tasks each day.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition to the daily tasks, use the audio program that came with
					The Confident Athlete to help guide you through your confidence
					program each day. Listen to the audio for Day 1 and then complete the
					workbook exercises before proceeding to the Day 2 audio.
				</p>

					See Table 1 on the following page for a description of each section
					for each day of the 14-day program.

					My definition of self-confidence is how firmly you believe in your

					is derived from a baseline assessment of past performances, training,
					and preparation.

					As your competency or skill mastery grows, your confidence becomes

					When asked about his confidence, 2005 Indy 500 Champion, Dan Wheldon

					He also said that confidence comes from the people around you and how
					well your race equipment is functioning. In sports, such as auto
					racing, the performance of the car can either improve or detract from
					the racers level of confidence.

				<blockquote>
					“Certainly confidence not only comes from yourself, I think it comes

					For some athletes, confidence can be fragile and vary depending on
					immediate results and beliefs or the self-talk they maintain prior to
					or during competition. One of the goals of your confidence program is
					to not let immediate results (or lack of) affect your current
					self-confidence. This requires that you understand the thoughts,
					doubts, or beliefs that undermine confidence.
				</p>
				<p>
					Self-doubt is the opposite of confidence and kills your momentum. You
					must reframe your negative thoughts by thinking of the bigger picture.
					Take confidence from the fact that your past experiences of success

					Unrealistic or irrational thinking is an area that I pay close
					attention to when working with athletes, because these irrational

					strict expectations, it won’t matter how much positive thinking you
					do.

					I concentrate on uncovering beliefs that athletes unknowingly embrace,
					which limit success. Some of these beliefs are often subtle,
					irrational or unrealistic. You must be able to identify negative
					selflabels that undermine your confidence level.
				</p>
				<p>
					The following are four common categories of unhealthy beliefs that can
					have a negative impact on your self-confidence. Your task today is to
					do some soul searching to identify the beliefs that sabotage your

					Perfectionists often stifle their confidence because they place
					unrealistic demands on themselves. Perfectionists, either consciously
					or subconsciously, set very strict expectations for performance. When
					they do not achieve their desired results, they become frustrated and
					their confidence level sinks like a lead balloon.
				</p>
				<p>
					Extremely high expectations can make you feel like a failure
					regardless of how well you do. So, you ask, “How do I know when I have
					perfectionistic traits that may be holding me back?” Below are some of
					the more common signs that your perfectionism is adversely impacting
					your performance:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Intense work ethic that breeds extremely high expectations.</li>
					<li>Easily frustrated when not performing well.</li>
					<li>Belief that you must be perfect to perform well.</li>
					<li>Tension or anxiety during your performance.</li>
					<li>
						Can’t play in the present, (the here and now) and/or your focus is

					Here is the conflict: Perfectionists think they have a good attitude
					but in reality, their attitude is poor due to the high demands and
					self-limiting beliefs they place on performance. Although some of the
					traits of perfectionism help athletes to succeed such as high goals,
					(which are different than unrealistic ones) determination, commitment,
					a strong work ethic, and not accepting mediocrity, perfectionists do
					not realize the disadvantages of perfectionism and how it can hurt
					confidence and cause anxiety.
				</p>
				<p>
					The following are behaviors that perfectionists engage in that are
					detrimental to the mission of developing ultimate self-confidence:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Setting unrealistic or very strict expectations.</li>
					<li>Dwelling on shortcomings.</li>
					<li>Fretting over past mistakes.</li>
					<li>Self-criticizing behavior.</li>

					<li>Constantly making comparisons to others.</li>
					<li>Over-analyzing performance.</li>
					<li>Viewing performance as good or bad with no middle ground.</li>
					<li>Measuring self-esteem based on sport-related success.</li>
					<li>
						Focus on future performance gains instead of the playing in the
						present, (the “now”.)
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					All of the above self-limiting beliefs directly or indirectly
					jeopardize the development of ultimate self-confidence and affect your
					self-esteem. Because this is so important, you must uncover and
					question the value of such beliefs. The next step in today’s
					confidence plan is to help you abolish some negative perfectionistic
					tendencies and replace them with a more functional mindset. The famous
					psychologist, Albert Ellis, calls this, “developing a more rational
					philosophy.”
				</p>
				<p>
					In Table 8, the most common traits of perfectionists are listed in the
					left column. The right column contains more functional traits or
					mindsets. Your task is to get more specific with each trait in the
					right column and list the specific behavior you can adopt, to
					eliminate the perfectionist traits.

					Confident athletes have a positive self-image and grasp positive

					Every person carries on an internal dialogue, which is known as

					today.” You want to bring awareness to any negative self-talk you
					maintain after you make a mistake.

					must adopt a mentality that supports confidence instead of reinforcing
					doubt.

					Doubt is the number one killer to a confident mindset. Pessimistic,
					perfectionistic and over-motivated athletes tend to hold on tight to
					doubts, which if unchecked can ruin an athlete’s mindset and derail
					performance. Some athletes start doubting before they even start the
					competition or make an error. Most athletes struggle with doubt after
					making a mistake or performing poorly in competition.
				</p>
				<p>
					When they let doubt run rampant and unchecked, it sabotages
					confidence. However, athletes who can recognize doubt and turn it into
					statements of confidence can counter the negative influence that doubt
					may have over them. The first step in overcoming doubt is to become
					aware of the thoughts that deteriorate confidence. The next step is to
					counter the doubts with thoughts that will lead to better outcomes.

					and address their major fears.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some regular and unusual challenges to anticipate may include
					difficult weather conditions, unfair officiating, rude spectators,
					psych-out attempts from competitors, poor play, bad luck, unexpected
					equipment problems and any other distractions you may encounter. Being
					mentally prepared to cope with any distraction or challenge, rather

					<li>
						Think back to when you got sidetracked by unanticipated distractions
						during competition.
					</li>
					<li>Prepare a written list of those distractions.</li>

						Record the situation, the distraction and your reaction to the

					</li>

				<h4>Example Coping Strategy</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Distraction:</strong>A fan in the stands starts to ride you
						when you are up to bat and you change your focus to his heckling.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Situation:</strong>You are up to bat with 2 men on base.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Coping action:</strong>You notice that you are focusing on
						unimportant cues to getting a hit. You decide to ask yourself what
						do you need to think about right now to have a successful at bat?
						You know that you must dig in and focus intensely on the pitcher and
						picking up the ball.

					Errors are just that—errors, but they can turn into a monster if you

					You must start with the realization that most intimidation in sports

					to not pay attention and look the other way.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, you can’t “look the other way” when you are your own worst
					enemy because you are intimidated by your own thoughts about the level
					of the competition, the weather conditions, or the venue you play.
					Athletes who lack confidence often look for others to help them feel
					confident. Likewise, these same athletes intimidate themselves by
					paying too much attention to other competitors or by putting other

					Patience is linked closely to confidence. A patient athlete is a
					confident athlete. Without patience, you are left with frustration and
					intolerance. Patience is the ingredient most needed when you hit the
					wall of adversity. Patience is a mental skill that is most needed when
					you are stuck in neutral and you can’t find any individual or team
					momentum./p>
				</p>
				<p>
					Impatience happens when an athlete feels desperate and is not
					performing up to their expectations. Webster’s defines patience as,
					“steadfast, despite opposition, difficulty or adversity.” In sports, I
					translate steadfast to confidence; so being patient in sports is
					having confidence in your ability despite opposition, difficulty or
					adversity.
				</p>
				<p>
					Patience is a form of confidence about the future that things will get
					better or improve with time if you wait for it. Athletes with a
					fragile state of confidence have trouble “waiting” for their
					performance to improve and thus lose patience and become frustrated
					easily.

					The first step in improving patience is to understand when and how you
					become impatient during competition. Awareness is once again the key
					here. Awareness allows you to prepare yourself to cope effectively
					with challenging situations that test your patience. Use the three
					step model below to help improve your patience.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Using the anticipation and cope model from Day 11, list the top five
						annoying situations in your sport that cause you to lose patience.
						For example, you keep making the same error and giving up the ball
						to the opposition. (Hint: these annoying situations could be
						mistakes you make, lack of results, or a competitor’s behavior or
						actions.)
					</li>
					<li>
						List the corresponding thought for each of the above situations.
						Using the example above, “I can’t stand giving up the ball. I am so
						frustrated because I hate getting the ball stolen.”
					</li>
					<li>
						Create your own personal coping method that will assist you in
						coping with adversity. This is similar to what you did in Day 11.
						Using the same example, “Stay calm, I can recover. Focus on making
						quality passes and everything will turn out.”
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Below is another example of a coping plan to help you complete this
					exercise:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Situation:</strong>Double fault two times in a row.</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Belief:</strong>“I can’t stand to double fault the game
						away. I am losing my cool over my crummy service game.”
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Coping:</strong>“Let it go, it’s done with. Stay patient and
						focused on hitting quality serves. I know you can recover this
						game.”
					</li>

				</p>

					You are armed with the information and tools to mold your confidence

					heights.
				</p>
				<p>
					I tell all my mental coaching students that learning is a three part
					process. The first part is the ability to understand the mental
					strategies that will help improve your mental game. The second stage
					is the ability to apply your mental strategies to your sport daily.
				</p>
				<p>
					The third and final stage is your ability to commit, over the long
					haul, to improving your confidence and mental attitude. Your learning
					is never complete without the diligence to stay committed to your
					mental training program.
				</p>
				<p>
					My suggestion is to review The Confident Athlete at least once a month
					and more often if necessary. Use the confidence scoreboard at the end
					of each section to help test your ability to apply the concepts after
					every competition. On the following page, I have included a summary of
					the action plans for each day of the 14 day program that will help you
					take action daily. Remove this page from your workbook and post it
					where you can see it every day. You should review these action plans
					often and work daily to apply 1-2 of the concepts to your practice,
					training, and competition!
				</p>
				<p>
					On the following page, you will find the final taking confident action
					commitment contract that you should review and sign now. Warning: if
					you sign the contract, be prepared to take massive action!

				<p>
					Athletes that begin a personal coaching program with me usually do not
					understand the difference between confidence (a positive attribute)
					and expectation (a negative attribute), at least the way I define
					them. However, by the end of the first session, my students do
					understand. Most people think if you have high expectations, you also
					must have high confidence. The question I often get is: If I expect to
					win or expect to play well, doesn’t that mean that I am confident that
					I can win or play well?
				</p>
				<p>
					My answer is a big “NO.” Even the sports psychology literature mixes
					the terms confidence and expectation, which I think is wrong. I
					however, define these terms for my students so they can understand how
					expectation and confidence are interconnected – that expectations are
					not healthy for developing supreme levels of confidence.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here is my conclusion after working with 1000’s of athletes: strict or
					high expectations can undermine and suck the life out of confidence.
				</p>
				<p>
					Let me explain my reasoning. First, some definitions are in order.
					Confidence is based on the strength of the belief in your ability or
					how strongly you think you can win. Expectation, on the other hand,
					are judgments and demands that you place on your performance usually
					pertaining to outcomes or personal statistics such as the number of
					points scored in a game.
				</p>
				<p>
					Confidence is simply a belief that precedes your performance such as
					when you see a good shot and feel like you will hit a good shot prior
					to execution. But confidence is void of strict expectations or the
					dire need to execute a good shot. In addition, a confident athlete
					does not judge the quality of the performance based on prior strict
					expectations, results or outcomes.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thus, I define confidence and expectation to have different meanings;
					expectations are dire needs or demands that you place on yourself
					about the quality of your performance – sort of judgmental demands
					because you constantly judge the quality of your performance and
					outcomes based on prior expectations. They are typically focused on
					results or a standard you have for your performance.
				</p>
				<p>
					Why are expectations so harmful to your confidence? First, you set
					yourself up for a win/lose proposition. You either achieve your
					expectations or you fail to achieve your expectations. Second, if you
					don’t achieve your predetermined expectations, it’s easy to question
					your ability that day either during or after your performance.
					Essentially, you set yourself up for failure before you even start.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most athletes who have experienced success at any level, naturally
					have very high expectations for their performance. I think
					expectations naturally develop from success. Athletes then think that
					an expectation-filled mindset for competition is the norm. After all,
					shouldn’t you expect great things from yourself? Expect the best and
					demand high levels of performance. It sounds good.
				</p>
				<p>
					Although this type of thinking sounds correct – it is not ideal
					because it sets you up for disappointment and frustration if you don’t
					execute on cue or achieve your expectations.
				</p>
				<p>
					What makes expectations even more harmful is athletes elevate their
					expectations to an extent that prices in a level of perfection. For
					example, expecting to throw a no-hitter every game, expecting to hit
					perfect shots, or expecting to not make any errors in the hockey game
					are all examples of strict expectations that are unrealistic and
					almost impossible to achieve.
				</p>
				<p>
					How many no-hitters did Nolan Ryan throw in his long, coveted career?
					Maybe a total of 6?
				</p>
				<p>
					Ben Hogan, one of the best ball-strikers in the history of golf wrote
					that he only hit 3-4 shots just as he imagined in his mind during a
					round of golf and the rest of the shots were just good misses. And how
					many hockey games have you played when you made zero errors. So the
					more unrealistic or perfectionistic your expectations, the harder they
					are to achieve – usually impossible to achieve, then the easier it is
					to fall short and judge your performance as inadequate or less than
					perfect.
				</p>
				<p>
					This type of thinking leads me to the conclusion that expectations are
					really harmful to confidence and the ideal scenario is to have high
					levels of confidence (based on past performance and training) without
					the judgmental behavior that comes with expectation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thus, one of my “Formulas for Success” that I teach to my students is
					to develop high levels of confidence void of any expectations at all.
					To do this I help athletes replace expectations by setting manageable
					goals that are not based on judgmental behavior.
				</p><h3>Four Case Studies on Harmful Expectations</h3>
				<p>
					To highlight the effects of high expectations on confidence and
					emotional control, I would like to share a few real-life case studies
					of students I have worked with from various sports.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<h4>NASCAR Driver Gets Frustrated</h4>
						<p>
							A couple years ago, a top 10 NASCAR driver approached me with a
							specific problem he was experiencing in the car. He said that when
							the race did not go according to his plan, he would become very
							agitated, frustrated, and lose confidence altogether.
						</p>
						<p>
							As we talked more about his thought process and past history, it
							was clear to me that his past success as a driver was actually
							working against him. Why? He had won races at every level of his
							career and his main goal was to win races and contend. But as time
							went on, his goals about winning turned into expectations about
							winning. He badly wanted to win races.
						</p>
						<p>
							Having high expectations about his performance actually made him
							unravel when he did not reach his expectations.
						</p>
						<p>
							When something went wrong with the equipment, such as a flat tire,
							this did not fit his expectations of winning or contending. And
							this is the danger of maintaining judgmental expectations. An
							athlete will likely become upset, frustrated, and even lose
							confidence when he or she can’t meet the strict demands set for
							performance.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Baseball Pitcher Loses Confidence</h4>
						<p>
							I worked with a college pitcher who maintained what I would deem
							as unrealistic expectations about his performance on the mound. As
							we talked about his goals for each game, it was clear to me that
							this ball player was placing very high expectations on his
							pitching performance.
						</p>
						<p>
							He wanted to throw a no-hitter every time he stepped on the mound.
							Throwing a no-hitter is equivalent to a perfect game in baseball –
							that is if you are the pitcher. A no-hitter is very hard to
							accomplish and rarely happens to even the best pitchers in
							baseball.
						</p>
						<p>
							So what do you think happened when his chances of a no-hitter were
							quashed when someone from the opposing team got a hit off him?
							That is right – he became upset and lost his composure for a few
							innings and by that time he would give up a few more hits!
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Golfer’s Perfectionism Leads to Low Confidence</h4>
						<p>
							Many of the golfers I work with have perfectionistic tendencies. I
							have not discovered if these tendencies are because of the
							personality of golfers or the game itself makes for perfectionism
							(most likely a combination of both), but I also see this in many
							other sports too.
						</p>
						<p>
							Anyway, one golfer I worked with had the expectation to hit
							perfect shots on the course. This is impossible in the game of
							golf. You can’t make a perfect swing every shot, hit the ball in
							the center of the club, have a perfect flight to the shot, and
							have it land next to the pit or right on the target on every shot.
						</p>
						<p>
							The game of golf is about managing misses instead of hitting
							perfect shots. So this golfer essentially started the round with
							an unrealistic expectation to hit the ball perfectly every shot.
							When he hit his first bad or even marginal shot, he would start to
							question his swing mechanics and wonder if he would hit the ball
							well enough to score a low round that day.
						</p>
						<p>
							This opened the gate for more mental errors. He would start to
							analyze the mistake and try to fix it on the course, which led to
							making more bad swings. Soon he would be so distraught with his
							inability to hit perfect golf shots that he wanted to just get off
							the course and go work on his golf swing.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Baseball Hitter’s Stats Get in the Way of At-Bat Focus</h4>
						<p>
							Do you ever go into a game thinking that you need to score at
							least 10 points in the basketball game, break 75 in the golf game,
							or create at least 3 assists each soccer game?
						</p>
						<p>
							Statistics are important in sports, don’t get me wrong, and can be
							used to improve your performance, especially to help you modify
							practice time. But the problem is that too many of my students
							have expectations about achieving their own statistical
							milestones.
						</p>
						<p>
							This particular student was way too concerned about his batting
							stats because he knew the scouts would be paying attention to his
							stats that year. He thought that getting signed with a good
							collegiate team depended on the quality of his statistics.
						</p>
						<p>
							Thus he would go into each game focusing on his hitting stats with
							specific expectations for hitting, which caused him to focus on
							the results instead of the process. As you can see, expectations
							often cause you to judge yourself in a game based on your
							preconceived demands. When he did not reach the desired hitting
							performance he felt he needed to reach, his performance got even
							worse because he would question his hitting ability and lose
							confidence.
						</p>
						<p>
							I have presented four of many examples in sports about how
							expectations focused on results, desired statistics, and
							unrealistic demands can sabotage your performance and negatively
							affect your confidence, especially when you don’t achieve your
							judgmental expectations.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol><h3>What is the Solution?</h3>
				<p>
					It might be obvious to you by now that I advocate a mindset void of
					expectations altogether. I teach my so-called “formula for success” to
					all my personal coaching students and peaksports.com members. This
					formula is a basic mental skill that all my students must master. The
					formula includes the following:
				</p>
				<h3>Dr. Cohn’s Mental Game Formula for Success #1</h3>
				<blockquote>
					Athletes must perform with no expectation and replace strict
					expectations with high levels of confidence and manageable objectives
					(or process goals).
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Many athletes find it difficult to perform without any result or
					performance expectations unless I am able to help them replace
					expectations (occupy their mind) with something more conducive to a
					process focus void of the judgments that come with expectations.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many athletes apply a “formula” that I think is a recipe for disaster
					– high expectations and low confidence. Do you expect perfection, but
					do not have the confidence to back it up? It should be just the
					opposite – and this is often a revelation for some of my students when
					I define the terms in my above formula and further discuss the
					ramifications of expectations on performance.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thus, having high confidence and manageable objectives gives you a
					positive, process focus in place of judgmental strict expectations and
					specific outcome-orientated results.
				</p>
				<h4>Therefore, three steps in the formula are:</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Identify strict, unrealistic expectations that affect your
						confidence negatively.
					</li>
					<li>
						Understand how to harness the power of confidence and how confidence
						differs from expectations
					</li>
					<li>
						Replace expectations with manageable objectives. Focus on manageable
						objectives or what I call mini-goals or process goals, but do not
						turn them into expectations.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Let’s take a closer look at these steps in the formula.</p>
				<h3>Step 1: Identify Your Own Limiting Expectations</h3>
				<p>
					This is the most difficult task for many of my students because
					expectations have become a natural part of their mental game and
					performance. When I talk about expectations, I refer to the strict
					demands you place on your performance. Instead of generating
					confidence, expectations become a desperate need for athletes – “I
					MUST finish in the top 10 this week, or the race is a failure.”
				</p>
				<p>
					If you are familiar with my philosophy about mental coaching, you know
					that focusing on results is not the best mindset for peak performance.
				</p>
				<h4>Below are some signs to help identify strict expectations</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Your “goals” focus on outcomes or results only.</li>
					<li>
						You constantly judge your performance based on personal standards.
					</li>
					<li>
						You become upset when you do not perform up to your own standards.
					</li>
					<li>
						You lose confidence when you do not achieve your personal standards.
					</li>
					<li>
						You expect to attain certain game statistics during your
						performance.
					</li>
					<li>
						On the occasion you perform up to your own standards, you feel no
						reward from this because you were “supposed to” perform that well.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>
					Below are a few questions you can ask yourself to flush out any
					expectations:
				</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						What results do you demand of yourself before the competition even
						starts?
					</li>
					<li>
						What personal statistics, such as points per game, do you feel you
						should achieve based on past performances, and would you be upset or
						frustrated if you did not reach these stats?
					</li>
					<li>
						Do you maintain unrealistic “goals” for your performance before
						competition? In which areas do you have to be perfect?
					</li>
					<li>
						Do you try to live up to other people’s expectations? What
						expectations do you adopt or take on from others – parents, coaches,
						or teammates?
					</li>
					<li>
						Do expectations about your scoring (or your team’s scoring) limit
						you when you exceed these expectations, keeping you stuck in a
						comfort zone?
					</li>
					<li>
						Do you generalize today about how you SHOULD perform based on past
						performances?
					</li>
					<li>
						Do you engage in name-calling with yourself or maintain negative
						personal descriptions such as “I’m a choker,” which influence your
						confidence?
					</li>
					<li>
						Are you easily frustrated when you don’t perform up to your minimum
						personal standards? What are the ways you think you should perform?
					</li>
					<li>
						Do you dwell and beat yourself up about how badly you performed?
					</li>
					<li>
						Do you have sudden temper tantrums over small errors during
						competition?
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Step 2: Perform with Confidence - not Expectation</h3>
				<p>
					A priority for your mental game is to focus all your energy on the
					process, also called the present moment, instead of outcomes or
					results. Focusing on results only serves to set expectations on your
					performance. Process goals or what I call manageable objectives help
					you focus attention on execution only, if applied correctly.
				</p>
				<p>
					The next step is to understand confidence and how this differs in its
					application to your performance. Confidence is a belief in your
					ability to execute a task at the most specific level. Confidence can
					also be the general belief in your ability to win or be successful.
				</p>
				<h4>How does confidence differ from expectation?</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Confidence precedes your performance or execution.</li>
					<li>
						Confidence is not judgmental about how well or poorly you are
						performing.
					</li>
					<li>Confidence thrives on momentum and good performance.</li>
					<li>
						Confidence is focused on the present moment and your ability to
						execute instead of the desire for obtaining outcomes or final
						results.
					</li>
					<li>
						Confidence is rational and built from training and past
						performances, expectations are usually irrational and outcome
						focused.
					</li>
					<li>
						Expectations chase results, positive results lead to confidence.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Step 3. Replace Expectations with Process Goals</h3>
				<h4>What are the steps for establishing process goals?</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Decide which aspects of your performance you want to improve or
						focus on that day.
					</li>
					<li>
						Set one or two process goals that will help you focus on execution.
					</li>
					<li>
						If you recognize that you are getting ahead of yourself or thinking
						about results or focused on expectation, refocus on your process
						goals.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>What are examples of process goals?</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Golf: Pick a specific target on every shot</li>
					<li>Tennis: Increase first serve percentage</li>
					<li>Hockey: Focus on quality back checking</li>
					<li>Football: Commit to the play call</li>
					<li>Swimming: Improve rhythm in the pool</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					I think you get the idea now. Process goals focus on the small tasks
					you need to do in the present moment that will help you perform well.
					The purpose of process goals is to help you become immersed in the
					present moment only and not really for the benefit of reaching small
					goals.
				</p>
				<p>
					Do not evaluate or judge if you are achieving your process goals!
					Although it’s rewarding to reach your goals, I don’t want you to
					assess or judge whether you’re on track because they will turn into
					expectations in this case. If you do, you are not focused on the
					process. Later, after the competition ends, you can assess how well
					you did with your process goals. In other words, reflect and evaluate
					on your performance after game time not during the game.
				</p><h3>The Confidence-Expectation Connection</h3>
				<p>
					I hope that you now understand the connection between confidence and
					expectations. You have learned that maintaining strict,
					perfectionistic, or unrealistic expectations can actually damper your
					feelings of confidence, especially when you feel your expectations -
					or the expectations you think others have for you - are not being met.
				</p>
				<p>
					Identifying and replacing expectations with manageable objectives or
					process goals must be a priority for you to develop ultimate
					self-confidence. This booklet is designed to be used in connection
					with “The Confident Athlete.”
				</p>
				<p>
					Take the first step now by identifying the expectations that undermine
					your confidence and limit your performance. This step alone will make
					a big difference in your mental game performance as it does with many
					of my personal coaching students. If you want personal help
					identifying and dispelling your expectations and improving your
					confidence, please contact me via email or phone.

					A 14-Day Plan for Maximum Composure
				</h3>
				<p>
					Welcome to The Composed Athlete: A 14-day Plan for Maximum Composure.
					You cannot compete at the highest levels of performance without
					composure of mind. As a matter of fact, without composure you will not
					be able to compete at any level of your sport(s) because you will hold
					yourself back with self-sabotaging feelings of inadequacy, worry,
					doubt, and fear. These are strong terms that frequently are
					encountered by athletes, but composed athletes are not influenced by
					these kinds of mental game “ball-and-chains.”
				</p>
				<p>
					The Composed Athlete teaches you everything I share with my individual
					mental coaching students when working in the area of emotional control
					and coping with pressure encountered by athletes. At the end of this
					program, you will have learned the key mental strategies to help you
					perform with great calmness of mind and confidence in your own
					self-control and ability to stay composed in crunch-time. In The
					Composed Athlete I provide you with a system to identify what mental
					breakdowns hold you back from composure, how to develop a mindset to
					thrive under pressure, and how to let go of mistakes that cause you to
					dwell in the past.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					“We maintained our poise. That's part of the maturity of our team,
					especially on the road. We don't lose our composure, and we do the
					right things down the stretch.”<cite
						>~ Michael Jordan, After Winning 3rd Consecutive NBA title</cite
					>
				</blockquote>

				<p>
					Your goal every time you hit the field, court, or course is to think
					like a champion by not letting competitors get under your skin and
					affect your confidence through mental preparation to cope effectively
					with mistakes or adversity.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most athletes and coaches understand that composure is very important
					to success, yet do not know the mental triggers or beliefs that drain
					athletes from keeping a calm, level head in competition. Composure is
					a very broad term in my work with athletes and as you will soon learn;
					there may be other mental barriers that ultimately affect your level
					of composure on the playing field. For example: some athletes focus
					too much on having the perfect performance or looking good to others
					(such as teammates, parents, coaches) and these mindsets affect
					composure during competition. The very first step to gaining superior
					composure as a competitor is to look internally to uncover the
					ineffective attitudes that undermine your ability to hang tough in
					moments of adversity. Then, the next step is to apply mental
					strategies to overcome the mental hurdles that prevent you from having
					full composure.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the nearly two decades I’ve worked with athletes from all sports
					and all levels, I have learned that mental skills for composure can be
					learned just as an athlete works at developing a perfect swing in
					baseball or dismount in gymnastics. The Composed Athlete teaches you
					how to identify your mental roadblocks to composure AND develop the
					mindset needed to enter competition with complete composure and
					steadfastness.
				</p><h3>How to use this program</h3>
				<p>
					Each day you will be given specific tasks to complete to work on your
					composure. Sometimes you will be given awareness exercises to help you
					identify mindsets that either undermine or contribute to success in
					sports. At the end of 14 days, you should be on your way to maximum
					composure in your sport. Every day of the program is divided into
					daily tasks which you need to complete to gain the most from the
					program. For maximum benefit from each daily composure boost, you
					should complete all the tasks, starting with Day 1.
				</p>

				<p>
					Use the audio program that accompanies The Composed Athlete to help
					guide you through the program. For example, you should listen to the
					audio for Day 1 and then complete the workbook exercises for Day 1
					before proceeding to the Day 2 audio and exercises.
				</p>
				<p>
					Table 1, below, is a description of the daily tasks you will complete
					in each section to enhance your focus.

							content: `<p>The first characteristic of a composed athlete is the ability to remain calm, steadfast, or in control during crunch-time or competitive pressure. The composed
athlete is a “gamer” or the person who thrives under competitive pressure, such as Tiger Woods when he has the lead in a golf tournament. Athletes with composure are able to raise the level of their play during competition – they thrive when the battle is close.</p>
				<p>The second main attribute of a composed athlete is the ability to remain composed emotionally when challenged by misfortune or after committing a mistake, such as Roger Federer’s ability to quickly let go of errors. Do the best athletes in the world get upset by mistakes? You bet! However, these athletes do not dwell on past mistakes or let mistakes compound into more mistakes. They don’t linger on frustration or lose focus and their ability to think straight. A motto that I teach all my students comes from one of my early mentors in sports psychology, Dr. Ken Ravizza:</p>
<blockquote>“You first must be in control of yourself before you can control your performance.”</blockquote>
				<p>Some people think that either you have composure or you don’t, and that you can’t change this twist of fate. In other words, you are either born with the gift of composure or not. For example, they believe that if you are a Type A personality you can’t change the fact that you become anxious in competition. This is simply false. You can learn the mental strategies that will give you a greater sense of inner composure and confidence that will enable you to perform at your peak every time you are in competition!</p>
				<p>You can learn the mental strategies that will give you a greater sense of inner composure and confidence that will enable you to perform at your peak every time you are in competition!</p>

	<h4>Thus, in summary, composure in athletics includes the following elements:</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>The ability to think calmly and rationally when under competitive stress.</li>
		<li>The ability to react calmly and rationally to errors during competition.</li>
		<li>The ability to rise to the challenge with confidence when called upon or as needed.</li>
		<li>The ability to identify and quickly extinguish mental barriers that undermine composure and cheat you from peak performance.</li>
	<li>The ability to “want the ball” with 1 minute left in the game with the belief that there is no better person to win than you.</li></ol>
</p><p>As an added bonus, if you are a leader in your team and can display maximum composure, other athletes will follow your lead and have confidence in your ability
to lead with poise.</p>`

					Competition is a bigger stage for many athletes and that means bigger
					stakes. The bigger the stakes, the harder it is to keep emotions in
					check. Actors refer to this state of mind, that is, being able to
					perform during practice but stumbling during performance, as “stage
					fright.” While the stage in acting may not be the same as it is for
					athletics, stage fright or performance anxiety can cause turbulence in
					the way that you play.
				</p>
				<p>
					The pressure you feel to perform well does not come from your
					environment or the quality of your opponent. Pressure and stress
					result from how you perceive the quality of your opponent or
					importance of the game. Some athletes get excited about playing a
					rival, but others are scared to lose for many different reasons—
					rejection by team members, an angry response from a coach, or
					disappointment from parents.
				</p>
				<p>
					If an athlete’s mental game foundation is weak, emotional composure
					will suffer too. An athlete with very high expectations for his
					performance, for example, is likely to become easily frustrated and
					lose control emotionally.
				</p>
				<p>
					Below is a list of the top eight mental errors that can challenge your
					composure. In the next few days of the program, I will address each of
					the mental errors.
				</p>
				<h4>Top Mental Game Breakdowns that Lead to Reduced Composure</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Perfectionism</li>
					<li>Worrying too much about what others think</li>
					<li>Irrational Belief</li>
					<li>Fear of Failure</li>

					Don’t get me wrong, perfectionism in sports is not all bad. In fact,
					perfectionism helps you work hard in practice and strive for
					perfection by mastering your skills and routines. However, most
					perfectionistic traits are not effective for helping you stay
					confident and composed on the playing field during competition and in
					addition, it has some real disadvantages.
				</p>
				<p>
					When you don’t reach the expectations you set for yourself, it is
					easier to become frustrated, resulting in a loss of composure. Many
					perfectionistic athletes struggle with fear of failure, which I will
					address in Day 6. Fear of failure causes a loss of composure when
					under stress in competition, because you become so anxious about
					results or outcomes and not failing.

					The first step is to identify the negative habits of perfectionism

					mental strategies to perform free without anxiety or fear of failure.
					What are the characteristics of perfectionism that you see in yourself
					when you perform or train?
				</p>
				<h4>Examples of Perfectionistic Traits:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Want to win badly, which leads to anxiety and fear of failure.
					</li>
					<li>
						Anxiety and fear cause you to perform tight and scared, or afraid to
						make mistakes.
					</li>
					<li>Worry too much about what other people think about your game.</li>
					<li>Try too hard to be perfect with your performance.</li>
					<li>Views performance as either good or bad, with no gray area.</li>
					<li>
						Try too hard and/or train more, which leads to higher expectations.
					</li>
					<li>Respond to mistakes with frustration and self-judgment.</li>
					<li>Think too much about technique or mechanics of the sport.</li>
					<li>Dwell on errors or mistakes, which leads to more frustration.</li>
					<li>
						Worry too much about future results, instead of playing in the
						present.
					</li>
					<li>
						Become anxious and have a need to over-control, especially in
						pressure situations.

				<h4>Five Tips for Developing a Healthier Attitude about Your Sport</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Strive for perfection in practice; accept you’re human and can’t be
						perfect in competition.
					</li>
					<li>
						Train yourself to focus on execution (For more information on
						concentration, see “The Focused Athlete,” part 2 in this series of
						performance enhancing books) instead of thinking ahead to “what
						ifs.”
					</li>
					<li>
						Be mindful of placing strict expectations on your performance.
					</li>
					<li>
						Stop caring or mind reading about what others may or may not be
						thinking about your game.
					</li>
					<li>
						Study and train hard for competition. Then “test” your skills with
						freedom, trusting the skills you have enhanced with routine
						practice.
					</li>
					<li>
						Learn to be more accepting of mistakes and encourage the ability to
						move forward and focus on the next play, shot, race, or routine.
					</li>
				</ol>

					Social approval is a need to be accepted, respected, or liked by
					others, which is a very common behavior in today’s society. Research
					done by Wake Forest University shows that social approval and
					disapproval influences how people feel about themselves./p>
				</p>
				<p>
					Social approval is an important phenomenon in my discussions with
					athletes that I coach. Many athletes rely too much on social approval
					to boost their own levels of self-worth. Some athletes think that if
					others respect their sports performance, this, for some reason, will
					make them a better person. Many athletes buy into this notion and
					think that they are better people if they can achieve acknowledgement,
					gain approval or respect from others through sports.
				</p>
				<p>
					How is social approval related to emotional composure? The need for
					approval from others becomes another source of pressure for many
					athletes. Athletes that crave approval from others to feel better or
					more confident, often become anxious in competition because the
					opportunity for embarrassment is present.
				</p>
				<p>
					What happens when an athlete badly wants respect or admiration from
					others? He or she is afraid to lose approval points by playing poorly
					or making mistakes. This sounds like fear of failure and it is a
					certain type of fear of failure. However, most of the time, craving
					approval causes you to read the minds of others and not really know
					what they are actually thinking - just unsubstantiated mind reading!

					The first step is to seek out any approval cravings you might have.
					People are motivated for many reasons and gaining approval from others
					is one of them. Below are the top seven categories of social approval
					that impact athletes:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Want others to see you as an achieving or successful athlete.</li>
					<li>
						Want others to respect you for your abilities as an athlete./li>
					</li>
					<li>Want to have a certain status from a group of athletes.</li>
					<li>Want social recognition from fans, media, or coaches.</li>
					<li>Want to impress or make others happy, such as a parent.</li>
					<li>
						Want to avoid feeling embarrassed and having others think badly of
						you.
					</li>
					<li>
						Want to avoid performing poorly for fear of not gaining respect.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Using the list above, write down the top two or three needs for
					approval you have experienced in the past, knowingly or unknowingly.
					It could be a variation of any one of the seven statements above:
				</p>
				<div class="container">
					<div class="container__row">
						1.
						<div class="container__col">
							<input
								class="txt-input social-approval-need"
								type="text"
								name=""
								id="q1"
								placeholder="..."
							/>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="container__row">
						2.
						<div class="container__col">
							<input
								class="txt-input social-approval-need"
								type="text"
								name=""
								id="q2"
								placeholder="..."
							/>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="container__row">

					</div>
					<button class="btn" id="saveSAN">Save</button
					><button class="btn" id="clearSAN">Clear</button>
				</div>
				<p>
					Once you identify the source of approval that you desire, consciously
					or unconsciously, you can tackle the issue head on. As you can see,
					some are desires (i.e., want respect from others) and some can be
					classified as fears (i.e., fear of embarrassment). Both have equal
					power to control you in competition.
				</p>
				<p>
					Given the two or three needs you identified above, the goal is to
					“convince” yourself that these needs are not relevant to your
					performance and should be a non-issue. To overcome the mental obstacle
					social approval creates is to debate the rationality of these needs
					and replace with a more effective belief system. Your objectives of
					this exercise are to:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Debate the rationality of a certain need you identified.</li>
					<li>Stop “mind reading” into what you think others think.</li>
					<li>
						Learn to approve of yourself and have self-respect and
						self-confidence.
					</li>
					<li>
						Learn to focus in the now, instead of worrying about what others may
						think if you perform well or poorly.
					</li>
				</ol>

					I want to dig down deeper into your mind and uncover another type of
					mental breakdown that causes you to feel pressure and then sabotages
					your performance – irrational beliefs.
				</p>
				<p>
					Irrational beliefs are thoughts, feelings, ideas, attitudes, or
					ingrained ways of behaving that are self-defeating and often not based
					on reality. They are often made-up stories in your mind, and similar
					to the process of mind reading, create additional stress, anxiety, or
					worry about your performance.
				</p>
				<p>
					How are irrational beliefs related to composure? Let me give you a
					real-life example:
				</p>
				<p>
					At the time I was drafting The Composed Athlete, I received a phone
					call from one of my racing students who was dealing with the issue of
					irrational beliefs. His challenge was that he viewed winning as
					success and anything less as failure. He was using all or none
					thinking. If he was passed on the track or did not have a chance to
					win, he became frustrated and stopped trying altogether. Needless to

					Your next task is to change your unhealthy beliefs that cause anxiety
					or pressure into healthy statements. This can be a difficult task if
					the belief is one that you have held on to all your life.
				</p>
				<p>
					The process begins by questioning yourself about these beliefs, a
					personal rebuttal to your own beliefs. Below is an example….
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Unhealthy belief:</strong> “If I don’t finish first in the
						race, I am a loser.”
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Rebuttal and healthy belief:</strong> “Winning does not make
						me a better person and losing does not mean I am a loser in life. I
						am not perfect and can’t win every race I enter. I accept this. I am
						a good person no matter if I win or lose in sport.”
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Look carefully at the beliefs that stifle your ability to perform with
					composure, confidence, focus, and consistency. Once you can identify
					these negative beliefs, it is easier to accept that change is
					necessary. Then, it is simply a matter of adapting your mindset by
					replacing irrational beliefs with healthy ones by taking an objective
					or rational approach.

					Fear of failure is a huge topic in sports psychology because many
					over-motivated, perfectionist athletes have some form of fear of
					failure. What is fear of failure?
				</p>
				<p>
					The best athletes in the world perform without the constraints of
					fear. But, that is because they have learned to master and control
					their thoughts, so that they can remain focused in the present,
					instead of dwelling on the past, or anticipating the future.
				</p>
				<p>
					Several mental game issues are linked to fear of failure, such as low
					selfconfidence, needless worry about making mistakes, fear of
					rejection or embarrassment, and the list goes on.
				</p>
				<p>
					Fears related to the fear of failure can be both rational (I don’t
					want to fall off the high bar”) and irrational (“I’m worried that
					others won’t like me if I’m not perfect”). Thus, today’s lesson ties
					in with your previous lesson on irrational beliefs.

					Step one is to identify the typical fears that athletes maintain in
					sports today. Most of these fears are born out of an intense need or
					desire to succeed. It may seem odd that fear of failure actually comes
					from a strong desire to succeed, but most fear of failure starts with
					a very motivated and determined individual who badly wants to win,
					achieve status, or be recognized for their achievements. The problem,
					however, is that this desire to win or be recognized actually results
					in the athlete focusing too much on the future and freezing up out of
					fear that his or her goals won’t be met.
				</p>
				<h4>What are the common fears associated with the fear of failure?</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Fear of losing a match, game, or race</li>
					<li>Fear of embarrassment</li>
					<li>Fear of letting others down</li>
					<li>Fear of not playing up to one’s potential</li>
					<li>Fear of not meeting expectations of others</li>
					<li>
						Fear of exhaustive efforts and not receiving any “pay off” for the
						hard work
					</li>
					<li>Fear of negative social evaluation</li>
					<li>Fear of not being accepted by others or not gaining approval</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The more you want to succeed, the harder it is to handle failure and
					the more you avoid it. In table 9, please check off the statements
					that are applicable to you.

				<p>
					The underlying causes for fear of failure can be classified into two
					main categories:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Fear of negative results or consequences (e.g. Fear of losing, fear
						of not performing during crunch time, etc.)
					</li>
					<li>
						Fear of not getting approval, acceptance or respect from others
						(Fear of letting down the team, coach, spectators or a parent.)
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					If you have identified three or more signs of fear of failure on the
					test in table 9, it is safe to say you have some form of fear of
					failure. Questions to consider:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Are you afraid of what others may think of how you are performing?
					</li>
					<li>
						Are you afraid of investing your time into practice and hard work,
						but in the end not reaping the benefit of your extended practices?
					</li>
					<li>
						Do you want to win so badly that you become anxious about the
						outcome and your performance suffers?
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Once you identify the specific fear, you must address it head on
					instead of just recognizing and trying to mask the symptoms in which
					fear manifests itself such as, anxiety, tension, and over-cautious
					play. Use reason and rationality to convince yourself that the fear is
					irrational and not based on fact.
				</p>
				<h4>Tips for Challenging your Fear of Failure:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Dispute the importance of your fear in the bigger picture of life.
						Does it really matter when you put it into perspective?
					</li>
					<li>
						Question the rationality of your fear – is it grounded in reality?
					</li>
					<li>
						Does holding on to this fear help you perform better or is it a
						functional necessity to your success?
					</li>
					<li>
						Are you procrastinating – hoping your fear will disappear on its
						own?
					</li>
					<li>
						Is this fear an absolute (written in stone) with no options to
						change?
					</li>
					<li>
						Do others encourage you to hold on to this belief unknowingly?
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Essentially, fear of failure focuses on all the wrong areas to be
					successful in sports. In the next lesson, I discuss how to be
					success-driven, not fear of failure driven.

					Several mental game challenges are linked to fear of failure, such as
					low selfconfidence, worry about making mistakes, fear of rejection or
					embarrassment, and several others. One of the problems associated with
					the fear of failure is an intense need to avoid failure, which causes
					you to think too much about not making mistakes or avoiding pain; or
					causes you to perform cautiously, scared, or too defensively.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the goals of The Composed Athlete is to help you perform
					fearlessly, without the mental traps that hold back performance
					potential. One way to accomplish this is to help you adopt a
					success-driven mindset that focuses on what you want to accomplish and
					helps you strive for positive outcomes.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the last session you identified your specific fear of failure(s).
					Today, you’ll learn how to replace avoidance behavior with a
					success-driven mindset.

					A success driven- approach focuses on what you want to achieve and
					task-relevant performance cues. It’s a focus in the moment, the here
					and now, and what you have to do to achieve excellence, while
					concurrently having a positive goal in mind. Athletes who take a
					fear-driven approach to their sport become paralyzed by trying to
					avoid failure, pain, or mistakes.

				<p>
					In table 10, I have listed common statements or beliefs athletes
					maintain that are avoidance behaviors. Your task is to become an

					You can’t perform your best or have maximum composure unless you have
					a strong foundation of self-confidence. I often discuss how doubt is
					the polar opposite of confidence – if you doubt your ability, you
					don’t have full confidence. Likewise, when you are not confident in
					your ability to perform well it opens the door for you to feel
					anxious, scared, worried, or apprehensive about your performance or
					the outcome of competition.
				</p>
				<p>
					What is self-confidence and how do you become confident?
					Self-confidence is simply the strength of your belief that you can
					successfully execute a skill in the present moment (for more
					information on self-confidence see The Confident Athlete Program).
					Self-confidence is knowing you have done the homework preparation
					through training and practice to succeed at your level and can win.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many forms of confidence exist. Confidence in your ability to stay
					composed is another important step to be in control of your emotions
					and react appropriately to mistakes and errors. The opposite can also
					be true in that some athletes repeatedly choke, become unglued
					emotionally in crunch time, and can never seem to be able to finish
					off a close competition. Thus they have very low self-confidence in
					their ability to display and apply the fundamentals of composure.

					Do you see yourself as a choker? Do you view yourself as someone that
					crumbles under the pressure? Do you think that you are a hothead and
					have no control over your emotions after setbacks or mistakes? If you
					answered yes to any of these questions, then you need to change how
					you view yourself (self-image) as a performer or athlete.
				</p>
				<p>
					Because you purchased The Composed Athlete program I suspect that you
					want to make positive changes to gain, keep and maintain your
					composure. This requires that I help you to (1) improve your
					self-image as a composed athlete and (2) help you gain confidence in
					yourself as a composed athlete, which is the overall aim of this
					program.
				</p>
				<p>
					Lets start by identifying some negative self-labels (names you give
					yourself that are not helpful), which undermine any confidence you may
					have in yourself as a composed athlete. Read the statements below. Can
					you identify with any of these negative self-labels or statements?
				</p>
				<h4>Negative Self-Labels about Composure</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>I choked in the past and I will continue to be a choker.</li>
					<li>
						I am not a big game player; I never perform well in big games.
					</li>
					<li>Others call me a hot head; I must be a hot head.</li>
					<li>I’m a Type-A athlete; I can’t relax and play my game.</li>
					<li>
						I crumble under the pressure of a big lead and find a way to lose.
					</li>
					<li>
						When I perform, I feel as though I am going to see the executioner
						because I am so scared to play badly.
					</li>
					<li>
						I am “Mr. Tension” on the playing field and never seem to relax and
						perform free during competition.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Although extreme examples, these statements show the negative affect
					that a poor self-image has on your performance. Your athletic
					self-image dictates your behavior in competition and you will default
					to this type of thinking when you are under pressure or adversity.
				</p>
				<p>
					Could you identify with any of the negative self-labels listed above?
					What are the negative self-labels you have adopted that undermine your
					confidence and your ability to be a composed athlete? List them here:

					I believe many athletes and performers limit their talents with
					so-called comfort zones, which is a type of mental barrier that is
					hard to break through. A comfort zone becomes a problem whenever an
					athlete is playing better than expected or is breaking new ground.
				</p>
				<p>
					A comfort zone is a mental barrier an athlete sets in his own mind
					based on preconceived notions and expectations about what is and what
					is not possible to achieve.
				</p>
				<p>
					Athletes from other sports also lose composure when performing beyond
					a comfort zone. Similar to the golfer in the example above, when an
					athlete or team feels out of place (winning a game they expected to
					lose) or in new uncharted territory, the tendency is to either become
					anxious and scared or defensive and protective. Composure is
					challenged when an athlete or team compares how they are performing to
					how they expect to perform.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					Preconceived notions about what might be possible, likely, or typical
					for one’s performance turn into a mental barrier that is often hard to
					shake.
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Therefore, part of developing maximum composure for crunch-time
					performances is the ability to perform without the mental handcuffs of
					a comfort zone.

					Begin by assessing your behavior when affected by a comfort zone. We
					do this by recognizing the signs that you are limiting your success
					with a comfort zone. The mental barriers of a comfort zone can affect
					athletes in various ways. Below are the most common symptoms that a
					comfort zone is impacting your performance.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						You get nervous, anxious, or afraid when playing better than
						expected.
					</li>
					<li>
						You compare how you are presently doing with how you expected to do
						before you started the competition.
					</li>
					<li>
						You “sit on your lead” and play defensively; not wanting to risk
						your current position, lead, score, etc.
					</li>
					<li>
						You are in “protect-the-lead” mode, such as when the golfer doesn’t
						want to give back a shot, the race driver protects his lead, the
						tennis player doesn’t want to drop a game when up 5-0, and the
						hockey team tries to maintain its 3-0 lead.
					</li>
					<li>
						You are in a hurry for the competition to finish because you don’t
						want your lead to disappear.
					</li>
					<li>
						You doubt whether you can maintain your lead and lose
						self-confidence.
					</li>
					<li>
						You worry about what others will think if/when you screw up a big
						lead.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Next, develop a solution by learning how to play without the mental
					constraints of a comfort zone. In Table 11 below, you will find a list
					of mental traps of the comfort zone in the left column. On the right,
					is a solution to each comfort zone mental trap. Your mission, if you
					choose to accept, is to match the correct mental strategy (fix) with
					the trap on the left.

					What do you think about when I mention intimidation? Do you think
					about that bully at school who intimidated all his classmates? Do you
					visualize becoming intimidated by an opponent that is verbally
					harassing you? Or, do you think about your own inner bully that uses
					intimidation to sabotage your performance?
				</p>
				<p>
					Some athletes resort to intentional intimidation such as verbal abuse
					or even bullying. Some athletes become intimidated by their own
					negative thoughts or fears that turn into pressure and mental
					gremlins. These “internal” intimidators are detrimental to peak
					performance and are known as self-intimidation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Self-intimidation is what you bring on yourself because you worry
					about your competition or the team you are about to play. From my
					perspective, selfintimidation is the most common type of intimidation
					in sports and is also the hardest intimidation to overcome. Why? You
					can easily ignore what others say to you, but you can’t ignore your
					own self-talk!
				</p>
				<p>
					Confident and composed athletes usually do not intimidate themselves.
					Instead, they are in control of their emotions and love the challenge
					of testing their skills against others athletes. The bigger and better
					the challenge, the more enjoyment they gain from the competition.
				</p>
				<p>
					Athletes who become self-intimidated feel anxious, scared, and
					pressured to perform their best if they want to win. They worry about
					performing against other athletes who are just as skilled. They
					sometimes compare themselves to better athletes. Making comparisons to
					athletes who you think are better than you, causes a lack of
					confidence and produces feelings of inferiority.

					Athletes can intimidate themselves in many ways, but it usually deals
					with how you perceive your skills compared to the skills of the
					competition. The most common ways that you may feel intimidated are:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Your opponent has an intimidating presence or look of confidence
					</li>
					<li>
						You do not feel like you belong, you feel out of place or lack
						confidence
					</li>
					<li>The reputation or record of your opponent precedes him or her</li>
					<li>
						You are in awe or put others on a pedestal or are “star-struck”
					</li>
					<li>
						You have advanced to a higher level of competition where everyone is
						just as good as you are if not better
					</li>
					<li>You are in awe of the situation or environment</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					As you can imagine, self-intimidation happens when you give your
					opponent too much power or attention by putting your competitors on a
					pedestal. When you feel intimidated you may relate to the following:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Anxious or scared about outcomes</li>
					<li>Doubt or lack of confidence in your ability</li>
					<li>Feel as if you don’t belong at the event</li>
					<li>Want to go hide and slip away unnoticed</li>
					<li>Afraid to embarrass yourself</li>

				<h4>No More Intimidation!</h4>
				<p>
					It should be clear to you now that self-intimidation happens because
					you either (1) focus too much on the competition or (2) you compare
					your skills, ability, or history to that of your competitors. Your
					first task is to avoid making comparisons to your competitors, which
					means you should not concern yourself with the reputation or status of
					whom you will compete against. Your second task is to avoid focusing
					on your competition at all unless your observations are important for
					strategy or game plans.
				</p>
				<p>
					With self-intimidation, most of this is in your mind. That means you
					are choosing to focus on the wrong thoughts and images prior to and
					during competition. Most intimidation begins prior to competition as
					you gawk in awe or worry about your inability to beat your opponent.
				</p>
				<p>
					If it begins in the mind, we can stop it before intimidating thoughts
					get out of control. I don’t like to go on a “no” campaign, but I think
					this lesson warrants drastic measures! Complete your own “stop the
					internal bully” statements at the end of Table 12.

					In the last session we discussed how athletes become self-intimidated
					and introduced some strategies to help you perform free of
					intimidation. Athletes who intimidate themselves focus too much on
					other athletes and the situation rather than what is under his or her
					direct control. Thus, this lesson applies to helping you with
					intimidation as well as your general mindset for composure.
				</p>
				<p>
					Do you spend too much energy worrying about things that you cannot
					control on the athletic field, court, or course? For example, have you
					ever been side-tracked because you were arguing with an official about
					a bad call he made even when you knew the official was not going to
					change his call? Most likely, you became upset or frustrated, lost
					your composure and it affected you for several minutes to follow or
					even the rest of the game.
				</p>
				<p>
					Focusing on things that are beyond your control is a distraction at
					the very least. As we discussed in the case of intimidation, focusing
					too much on your opponent’s record or abilities can lead to composure
					breakdowns. We can classify all resultoriented thinking about outcomes
					into thoughts or “events” that are beyond your direct control (in the
					present moment). Athletes who focus too much on results, instead of
					the process, are likely to become anxious, scared, worried, and
					perform tentatively at best.
				</p>
				<p>
					As part of your plan for developing maximum composure, you must train
					yourself to focus only on the stuff in your personal and immediate
					control. Thus, we can break down the competitive arena into two areas:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Things that you control:</strong> your thoughts, behaviors,
						performance, and reactions in both practice and competition.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Things beyond your control:</strong> events or persons that
						you cannot influence during competition and which cause you to
						become sidetracked from your real mission such as a heckler in the
						stands or rude competitors.
					</li>
				</ul>`

					The next step is to get more specific with the factors you can control

					you can and cannot control:
				</p>
				<h4>Factors you can control in putting</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Your preshot routine</li>
					<li>Your plan for the putt or read</li>
					<li>The images you use during the routine</li>
					<li>Your general mental preparation for the putt</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Factors you cannot control in putting</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>The condition of the greens</li>
					<li>How your playing partners behave</li>
					<li>The weather conditions</li>
					<li>
						The effects of wind, spike marks on the green, and the “lumpy donut”
						or shoe prints around the hole
					</li>
					<li>The final outcome of the putt</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Now it’s your turn. Please describe what you can control in your sport
					and the factors that are beyond your control in table 14.

					Emotional control is essential to peak performance in sports.
					Emotional control is a huge facet of composure. So far, the lessons
					have focused on dealing with competitive pressure, intimidation, and
					anxiety. Every athlete at one time has become upset, frustrated, or
					angry at his or herself (or other people). How you perform will depend
					on your ability to let go and stay composed after errors.
				</p>
				<p>
					Emotional control and letting go of errors is such an important mental
					skill in sports psychology that I have devoted two lessons to this
					topic. Many fine athletes sabotage their own performance because they
					do not have the skills to cope with adversity and have not learned the
					skills to control their emotions. Highly motivated athletes with
					perfectionistic tendencies are particularly prone to becoming upset
					and frustrated with mistakes or when not performing up to
					expectations.
				</p>
				<p>
					What is emotional control? Emotional control is the ability to stay
					even tempered, level headed, or have a calm mind when you are
					challenged by mishaps or adversity. Even the top athletes in the world
					can become upset with their performance, but they are able to stay in
					control and get back to business or execution quickly, and that’s what
					separates the great athletes who recover from mistakes from the good
					athlete who cracks and is lost for the remainder of the competition.
				</p>
				<p>
					One important point to keep in mind: No one person (or event that
					occurs) can make you feel frustrated but yourself! Yes, you might feel
					frustrated by striking out when your team most needs you, or missing a
					short putt that costs you the match win. However, you must understand
					that it’s not the strike out or missed putt that causes frustration,
					rather it’s your belief or perception about these events that creates
					frustration.

					I teach my students to approach emotional composure two ways: (1)
					taking a supportive pregame mindset into competition and (2) learning
					to let go of errors before emotions snowball out of control. You have
					to both prepare an accepting mindset before you compete and arm
					yourself with mental strategies to cope your best.
				</p>
				<p>
					What is the correct mindset you should take to competition to be more
					accepting of yourself? A mindset void of expectation and free of
					judgment for starters. The first step is to identify strict
					expectations that cause you to lose your composure when you think that
					you expectations are not met. Let’s begin with a test of your
					knowledge of the terms in table 15 below.
				</p>
				<h4>Table 15. Matching Game – Definitions of Basic Terms</h4>

						</div>
						<div class="container__col">

					</div>
					<div class="container__row">
						<div class="container__col container__row-title">6. Mistake</div>
						<div class="container__col">
							F. Unhealthy feelings or thoughts you maintain about your

						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>
					One of your mental game objectives is to play without expectations
					that can cause you to become easily frustrated if you don’t match your
					own expectations.
				</p>
				<p>Expectations that can lead to feelings of frustration include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I must play perfectly to be successful today.</li>
					<li>
						I expect to perform perfectly today and if I don’t, I am worthless.
					</li>
					<li>I cannot make any mistakes if I want to win.</li>
					<li>To play my best, I must have an error-free performance.</li>
					<li>I expect my teammates to be perfect and not make errors.</li>
					<li>
						I should get upset when I make errors to show others that I am
						really a better athlete.
					</li>
					<li>I won’t encounter any bad luck.</li>
					<li>
						If I make a mistake, I should automatically be upset or frustrated.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					As you can tell from this list of expectations, you would have little
					room to NOT BE PERFECT. How often have you performed perfectly or had
					a perfect game? Not often, maybe never. Now it’s your turn. Please
					list the expectations you maintain going into competition that if you
					do not achieve, you become upset, angry, or frustrated with your play.

					Part of mental preparation is preparing your mind to cope with
					anything that could happen during competition in which would cause you
					to lose your composure or become frustrated. You can start by
					reviewing your past performances when you lost your composure. Has an
					opponent tried to psych you out with negative comments? Have you ever
					lost control on a referee for making a bad call? Do you get upset when
					your coach yells at you for mistakes? You get the idea.
				</p>
				<p>
					In your next lesson, I will give you a system for coping with errors
					when they happen, but for now I want you to anticipate situations that
					may rattle your cage and cause you to lose your composure.

					In the last lesson, I introduced the concept of emotional control for
					dealing with setbacks and why this is important for composure.
					Emotional composure is enhanced when you take a non-judgmental and
					accepting attitude into competition. Emotional control is the ability
					to stay even tempered, level headed, or have a calm mind even when you
					are challenged by mishaps or mistakes. But, what few athletes
					recognize is that emotional control strategies begin before you enter
					competition.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many athletes perceive that they are victims of their circumstances –
					if the tennis player double faults, for example, it’s the double fault
					that causes emotional turmoil. The problem lies in being reactive
					instead of proactive when faced with adversity during a game. If you
					buy into the belief: “I have no control over my emotions and I cannot
					help feeling upset when the game does not happen according to my
					plan,” you are prone to lose control. This irrational belief causes
					you to feel helpless without any control over your circumstances.
				</p>
				<p>
					I teach my students that they have a free-will and have the choice to
					react to adversity with composure instead of helplessness or out of
					negative habits. This means using proactive strategies to cope with
					adversity instead of reacting out of ineffective habits. Proactive
					athletes plan and strategize how they will cope with mishaps or trying
					situations when they aren’t in the midst of the emotions of the crisis
					moment. They learn preset mental strategies to help them stay composed
					and react with emotional stability – and this is the goal of today’s
					lesson.

					Borrowing from a famous psychologist Albert Ellis, he would say that,
					people are not frustrated or upset about by events that happen to
					them, but rather they become upset or disturbed by the way people
					think about them. He would say that the fact you make a “mistake” such
					as a three-putt is not frustrating in itself. Rather, frustration
					comes from how you perceive the “event” and what beliefs you maintain
					about the event or mistake.
				</p>
				<p>
					This means we need to modify the old habits or ways of thinking about
					mistakes so you can be more composed. This requires that you learn how
					to disagree with (or dispute) your thoughts or beliefs about mistakes
					and replace these with more functional ways of thinking, which will
					lead to improved emotional control.
				</p>
				<h4>4 Steps to Better Emotional Control:</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<strong>List</strong> an event or mistake that causes you
						frustration.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Identify</strong> the beliefs or thoughts you maintain that
						cause you frustration.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Replace</strong> the belief or thoughts with ones that will
						help you play on with composure.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Proactively practice</strong> your coping strategies (or new
						beliefs) prior to competition.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>Here is an example of the process:</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>The mistake: 3-putting in golf</li>
					<li>
						The belief that causes frustration: “I am too good to 3-putt from 30
						feet. I will never shoot a good score if I keep doing that!”
					</li>
					<li>
						Your revised thinking about this mistake: “Even the best players in
						the world 3-putt occasionally. I will recover and putt well the rest
						of the day.”
					</li>
					<li>
						Practice this coping strategy in your regular training. You can also
						imagine making the mistake and applying your new thinking process.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					The goal is to improve your thinking about mistakes so you can play on
					with composure. I tell my students to find a way to make the mistakes
					“OK” in their own mind. This is an accepting mindset. I am not saying
					mistakes are OK, I am pointing out the fact that you must accept it –
					any way you can – so you can move on with a free mind to the next
					shot, play, or point.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now it’s your turn to challenge or dispute your thoughts that cause
					you to feel frustrated:

				<p>I inform all my mental game coaching students that learning any skills, especially mental skills, is a three part process. The first part is the ability to understand the mental  strategies that will help improve your mental game. The second stage is the ability to apply your mental strategies to your sport daily. The third and final stage is your ability to commit, over the long term – months and months, to improve your focus and mental attitude. Your learning is never complete without the
diligence to stay committed to your mental training program.</p>
				<p>My suggestion is to review The Composed Athlete at least once a month and
more often if necessary. Use the “Scoreboard” sections at the end of each session
after every performance to help you identify areas to improve. On the following
page, I have included a summary of the action plans for each day of the 14-day
program that will help you take action daily. Remove this page from your workbook
and post it where you can see it every day. You should review these action plans
often and work daily to apply 1-2 of the concepts to your practice, training, and
competition! On the following page, you will find the final Taking Composed Action
commitment contract that you should review and sign now. Warning: if you sign the

				<div>
					<ul>
	<li><strong>I commit</strong> to mentally rehearsing what it feels like to be my composed model athlete.</li>
	<li><strong>I commit</strong> to recognizing when I am committing mental game errors and to become more
aware of mental breakdowns that undermine composure.</li>
	<li><strong>I commit</strong> to accepting that I can’t be perfect as an athlete.</li>
	<li><strong>I commit</strong> to accepting that it’s OK and natural to make mistakes.</li>
	<li><strong>I commit</strong> to stop the mind reading of what I think others expect of me.</li>
	<li><strong>I commit</strong> to recognizing when I crave approval from others via my performance, and
know the only opinion that matters is my own!</li>
	<li><strong>I commit</strong> to replacing my irrational thoughts about my performance with new, healthy
beliefs.</li>
	<li><strong>I commit</strong> to identifying fears I hold on to that hold me back from performing to my full
potential or ability.</li>
	<li><strong>I will</strong> challenge my fears and replace them with growth-oriented statements.</li>
	<li><strong>I commit</strong> to setting success-driven goals that will focus my mind on achieving what I
want instead of what dwelling on the past or predicting the future.</li>
	<li><strong>I commit</strong> to identifying negative self-images and replacing them with a strong, confident
self-image.</li>
	<li><strong>I commit</strong> to breaking free of any self-imposed comfort zones that hold me back.</li>
	<li><strong>I commit</strong> to being the intimidator instead of letting others intimidate me.</li>
	<li><strong>I commit</strong> to focusing only on the thoughts I can control in my sport experience.</li>
	<li><strong>I commit</strong> to note any unrealistic expectations that may leave me feeling frustrated if I
don’t achieve them.</li>
	<li><strong>I commit</strong> to reacting to errors with full composure and quickly letting them go from my
mind.</li>
	<li><strong>I commit</strong> to use my pre-determined coping strategies for letting go of errors on a daily
basis.</li>
	<li><strong>I commit</strong> to using the pregame routine to help me develop a composed attitude.</li>
