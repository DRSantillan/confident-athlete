		<h3>Day 1 - Warm-up</h3>
			<p>
				For many athletes, fear and fear of failure are a constant source of <mark> stress</mark> or anxiety that sabotages performance. <strong> What is fear?</strong> Miriam-Webster defines
				fear as <blockquote>“an unpleasant often strong emotion caused by anticipation or awareness of danger.” </blockquote> In tennis, most of the fear athletes refer to is not about being in danger or harming themselves physically. The fear I am talking about is a <mark>psychological threat</mark> that is often based on an <mark>athlete’s perception</mark> of the importance of a performance or game and what others think about his or her performance.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most of the time, an athlete’s fear is <strong>worry related to poor results - whether prior to or during a
					performance.</strong> Athletes often fear the negative consequences of their performance. They worry about
				many things that are often not under their control.

			<h3>Day 1 - Fearless Strategy</h3>
			<p>
				Fear of failure is one of the major barriers to success for athletes. Understand that your fear does not emerge from an opponent or a difficult game.
			</p>
			<p>
				In Table 1 is a self-test to take that measures your fear in sports and lack of self-trust. Place a check mark next to the statements with which you agree.
			</p>

			<div>
				<div>
					<div class="chkbox">
						<input type="checkbox" class="fear-trust" id="t1a1">
					</div>I have difficulty taking my “practice game” to competition.
				</div>
				<div>
					<div class="chkbox">
						<input type="checkbox" class="fear-trust" id="t1a2">
					</div>My level of “competitive self-confidence” does not match the level of my practice self-confidence. (I feel more confident in practice than when in competition).
				</div>
				<div>
					<div class="chkbox">
						<input type="checkbox" class="fear-trust" id="t1a3">
					</div>I want to win or succeed badly and this leads to cautious performances because I am afraid to make mistakes.
				</div>
				<div>
					<div class="chkbox">
						<input type="checkbox" class="fear-trust" id="t1a4">
					</div>I focus too much on results or outcomes of my performance (such as the need for a certain score), and thus have a hard time enjoying the process.
				</div>
				<div>
					<div class="chkbox">
						<input type="checkbox" class="fear-trust" id="t1a5">
					</div>I can become impatient with myself if I don’t perform well in	competition and want improvements in practice to happen faster.

				<div>
					<div class="chkbox">
						<input type="checkbox" class="fear-trust" id="t1a6">

				<div>
					<div class="chkbox">
						<input type="checkbox" class="fear-trust" id="t1a7">
					</div>I care too much about what others think and make assumptions that are not based in reality, such as my parents will not drive me to practice if I don’t perform well.
				</div>
				<div>
					<div class="chkbox">
						<input type="checkbox" class="fear-trust" id="t1a8">
					</div>I have a fear of letting others down if I don’t perform up to their expectations. For example, I wrongly assume that my teammates will not like me if I give up the winning goal.

			<h4>Assessing your results: </h4>
			<p>
				If you checked “yes” to five or more of the statements above, it’s a good bet that <mark>fear of failure hinders your focus in competition</mark> and causes a lack of trust.
			</p>
			<p>If you
				checked “yes” to one or more statements above, you still may need to address this mental game barrier as you may have at least some perfectionistic tendencies.</p>
			<h4>What are the common types of fears for tennis players?</h4>
			<p>Its not enough to know that you have fear of failure. Whats more important is to know what type of fear holds you back. As you can see from the list below, fear of failure often is related to what you assume others think about you.</p>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Fear of losing a match or game</strong> - you badly want to win and are afriad you will not win.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Fear of negative social evalution</strong> - you fear others will view you as a failure in tennis.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Fear of embarrasment</strong> - you are afraid to enbarrass yourself in front of others if you dont perform well.</li>
					<li><strong>Fears of letting others down</strong> - you do not want to lwt others down such as a couch or parent.</li>
					<li><strong>Fear of puttin in the effort and not ever getting the "pay off"</strong> or not playing to your potential. You dont want tour hard work, talent and long practices to result in nothing. (wins, trphiesm
						etc)</li>
					<li><strong>Fear of not performing up to others expectations</strong> - you worry about not meeting others expectations for you</li>
					<li><strong>Fear of being rejected</strong>, losing respect, or not gaining approval.</li>
					<li><strong>Fear of making mistakes</strong> and not performing perfectly after having worked so hard at it.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p><strong><mark>Do any of the above fears sound familiar to you?</mark></strong> </p>
			<p>The first step in managing your fear of failure is to understand the specific source of your fear. By the end of the 14-day program, I will help you overcome the fears outlined here.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="mottos">
			<h3>Day 1 - Success Mottos</h3>
			<p>Each day, you will be guided through a short period of relaxation (an abdominal
				breathing exercise) followed by a simple guided mental imagery exercise. <p> Please
					repeat the following mottos (or affirmations) to yourself two times in the guided
					imagery exercise.</p>
				<ol>
					<li><mark> Fear does not run my life or tennis performance. I am in control.</mark></li>
					<li><mark> The only thing to fear is fear itself.</mark></li>
					<li><mark> I can learn to perform fearlessly without tension or anxiety.</mark></li>
				</ol>
			</p>
		</section>

		<section class="action-plans">
			<h3>Day 1 - Action Plans</h3>
			<p>Think back to a time when you performmed free of fear, anxiety or tension.<ul>
					<li> <mark>Try to recall what it felt like to you.</mark></li>
					<li><mark>Did you feel confident in your ability? </mark></li>
					<li><mark>were you focused on performing well? </mark></li>
					<li><mark>did your performance come naturally or easy?</mark></li>
					<li><mark>Relive the experience and how it felt</mark></li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>Based on the self-test you took above, your task is to keep track of how often you experience these signs when
				you perform.

			</p>


		</section>
		<section class="progress">
			<h3>Day 1 - Progress Assessment</h3>
			<p>Assess your progress is a self-awareness or tracking exercise based on one of the
				action plans in your workbook. Each exercise is designed to help you evaluate how
				successful you are with the daily lesson and to bring more attention to this area.</p>
			<p>Instructions are provided to help you complete each exercise. In your next
				competition, keep track of the situations that cause you to experience any of the
				signs of fear of failure listed in Table 1.</p>
			<p>This awareness exercise will help you <mark>identify your specific fear and when fear of
					failure is limiting your performance</mark>. I have included an example below to help you
				get started.</p>
