			<h2>Day 1 - Warm-up</h2>
			<p>For many athletes, fear and fear of failure are a constant source of stress or anxiety
that sabotages performance. What is fear? Miriam-Webster defines fear as “an
unpleasant often strong emotion caused by anticipation or awareness of danger.” In
sports, most of the fear athletes refer to is not about being in danger or harming
themselves physically, although in some sports such as football, gymnastics or
motocross you can be physically injured. The fear I am talking about is a
psychological threat that is often based on an athlete’s perception of the
importance of a performance or game and what others think about his or her
performance.</p>
<p>Most of the time, an athlete’s fear is worry related to poor results - whether prior to
or during a performance. Athletes often fear the negative consequences of their
performance. They worry about many things that are often not under their control.</p>

<section class="attitude">
	<h2>Day 1 - Attitude Assessment</h2>
	<p>Each day, you will be given a short mental game assessment, which includes three
important questions related specifically to the day’s topic. If you answer “yes” to
the questions, place a check in the box to the right of the question.</p>		
	<p>Answer the following mental assessment honestly, by yourself seek no help in answering these responses. </p>
			<p>
				<h4>Fearless Athlete Day 1 - Mental assessment</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><input type="checkbox" name="q1" id="">I worry so much about results that I get a queasy feeling in my stomach
before or during competition and it does not go away after I begin. </li>
					<li><input type="checkbox" name="q2" id="">I want to win so badly that I try too hard and get in my own way. I feel
tense because I worry about failing or not playing well.</li>
					<li><input type="checkbox" name="q3" id="">I care so much about what others think that I worry about disappointing
others and this affects my mindset.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
</section>
<section class="objective">
<h2>Day 1 - Objective</h2>
			<p>To understand common fears and anxiety in sports – not all fear is rational or based
on reality. The goal is to recognize the fear that prevents you from performing
freely at your peak potential.</p>
			
</section>
<section class="strategy">
	<h2>Day 1 - Fearless Strategy</h2>
			<p>Fear of failure is one of the major barriers to success for athletes. Understand that
your fear does not emerge from an opponent or a difficult game. In Table 1 is a
self-test to take that measures your fear in sports and lack of self-trust. Place a
check mark next to the statements with which you agree.</p>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li><input type="checkbox" name="" id="">I have difficulty taking my “practice game” to competition.</li>
					<li><input type="checkbox" name="" id="">My level of “competitive self-confidence” does not match the level of
my practice self-confidence. (I feel more confident in practice than
when in competition).</li>
					<li><input type="checkbox" name="" id="">I want to win or succeed badly and this leads to cautious performances
because I am afraid to make mistakes.</li>
					<li><input type="checkbox" name="" id="">I focus too much on results or outcomes of my performance (such as
the need for a certain score), and thus have a hard time enjoying the
process.</li>
					<li><input type="checkbox" name="" id="">I can become impatient with myself if I don’t perform well in
competition and want improvements in practice to happen faster.</li>
					<li><input type="checkbox" name="" id="">I often feel like my self-esteem is threatened when I do not perform up
to my own expectations.</li>
					<li><input type="checkbox" name="" id="">I care too much about what others think and make assumptions that
are not based in reality, such as my parents will not drive me to
practice if I don’t perform well.</li>
					<li><input type="checkbox" name="" id="">I have a fear of letting others down if I don’t perform up to their
expectations. For example, I wrongly assume that my teammates will
not like me if I give up the winning goal.</li>
					<li><input type="checkbox" name="" id="">I tighten up or become tense in competition and can’t perform freely.</li>
					<li><input type="checkbox" name="" id="">I play with too much physical tension and have trouble playing relaxed
and free because I try to over-control my movements or performance.</li>
					<li><input type="checkbox" name="" id="">I try too hard to win and thus get in my own way mentally with a lack
of trust.</li>
					<li><input type="checkbox" name="" id="">I try to be perfect with my execution and thus get tense, try to overcontrol
my body, or get frustrated when my game is imperfect.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<h4>Assessing your results: </h4><p>
				If you checked “yes” to five or more of the statements above, it’s a good bet that
fear of failure hinders your focus in competition and causes a lack of trust. If you
checked “yes” to one or more statements above, you still may need to address this
mental game barrier as you may have at least some perfectionistic tendencies.
			</p>
			<h4>What are the common types of fears for tennis players?</h4>
			<p>Its not enough to know that you have fear of failure. Whats more important is to know what ttype of fear holds you back. As you can see from the list below, fear of failure often is related to what you  assume others think about you.</p>
<p>
				<ul><li>Fear of losing a match or game - you badly want to win and are afriad you will not win.</li>
				<li>Fear of  negative social evalution - you fear others will view you as a failure in tennis.</li>
				<li>Fear of embarrasment - you are afraid to enbarrass yourself in front of others if you dont perform well.</li>
				<li>Fears of letting others down - you do not want to lwt others down such as a couch or parent.</li>
				<li>Fear of puttin in the effort and not ever getting the "pay off" or not playing to your potential. You dont want tour hard work, talent and long practices to result in nothing. (wins, trphiesm etc)</li>
				<li>Fear of not performing up to others expectations - you worry about not meeting others expectations for you</li>
				<li>Fear of being rejected, losing resoect, or not gaining approval.</li>
				<li>Fear of making mistakes and not performing perfectly after having worked so hard at it.</li></ul>
			</p>
			<p>Do any of the above fears sound familiar to you? </p>
			<p>The first step in managing your
fear of failure is to understand the specific source of your fear. By the end of the
14-day program, I will help you overcome the fears outlined here.</p>

<section class="mottos">
	<h2>Day 1 - Success Mottos</h2>
			<p>Each day, you will be guided through a short period of relaxation (an abdominal
breathing exercise) followed by a simple guided mental imagery exercise. <p> Please
repeat the following mottos (or affirmations) to yourself two times in the guided
imagery exercise.</p> <ul><li>Fear does not run my life or tennis performance. I am in control.</li>
			<li>The only thing to fear is fear itself.</li>
			<li>I can learn to perform fearlessly without tension or anxiety.</li></ul></p>
</section>

<section class="action-plans">
	<h2>Day 1 - Action Plans</h2>
			<p>Think back to a time when you performmed free of fear, anxiety or tension.<ul><li> Try to recall what it felt like to you.</li><li>Did you feel confident in your ability? </li><li>were you focused on performing well? </li><li>did your performance come naturally or easy?</li><li>Relive the experience and how it felt</li> 
			</ul></p>
			<p>Based on the self-test you took above, your task is to keep track of how often you experience these signs when you perform.

<section class="progress">
	<h2>Day 1 - Progress Assessment</h2>
			<p>Assess your progress is a self-awareness or tracking exercise based on one of the
action plans in your workbook. Each exercise is designed to help you evaluate how
successful you are with the daily lesson and to bring more attention to this area.</p>
<p>Instructions are provided to help you complete each exercise. In your next
competition, keep track of the situations that cause you to experience any of the
signs of fear of failure listed in Table 1.</p>
<p>This awareness exercise will help you identify your specific fear and when fear of
failure is limiting your performance. I have included an example below to help you
get started.</p>
