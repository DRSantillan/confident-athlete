			<h2>Day 1 - Warm-up</h2>
			<p>
				For msny Athletes, fear and fear of failuire are a constant source of
				stress and anxiery that sabotages performance.

				<em>What is Fear</em>
				Fear is an unpleasant often strong emotion caused by anticipation or
				awareness of danger. In tennis, most of the fear athletes refer to is
				not about being in danger or harming themselves phusically. The fear I
				am talking about is a pyschological threat that is often based on an
				athletes perception of the importance of a performance or game and what
				others think about his or her performance.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most of the time, an athletes fear is worry related to poor results -
				whether prior to or during a performance. Athletes often fear the
				negative consequences or their performance.
			</p>
			<p>
				They worry about many things that aare often not under their control.
				Some Athletes are afraid to not perform up to their own potential after
				putting in so much work and effort.
			</p>
			<p>
				Other athletes are afraid to fail and fear disappointing coaches or
				their parents. Other athletes perform poorly because they want to avoid
				embarrasment.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, the threat athletes feel in these situations can sometimes be
				irrational and not based on reality. Worrying about what others think
				about you if you hit a bad shot is often not rational and based on false
				assumptions you make about others.

<section class="strategy">
	<h2>Day 1 - Fearless Strategy</h2>
			<p>Fear of failure is one of the major barriers to success for athletes. Understand that your fear does not emrge from an poopnent or a difficult game. Fear of failure comes from within oneself. Fear will often make you perform tense, cautious, careful and create a lack of risk taking. </p>
			<p>Table 1 is a self test to take that measures your fear in tennis and lack of self-trust. Check the statements that you feel are true.</p>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li><input type="checkbox" name="" id="">I have difficulty taking  my practice game to competition</li>
					<li><input type="checkbox" name="" id="">My level of "competitive self-confidence" does not match the level of practice self-confidence. (I feel more confident in practice than when I play competitively.)</li>
					<li><input type="checkbox" name="" id="">I want to win or succeed badly and this leads to cautious performances because I am afraid of  making mistakes</li>
					<li><input type="checkbox" name="" id="">I focus too much on results or outcomes of my performance(such as the need for a certain score), and thus have a hard time enjoying the process.</li>
					<li><input type="checkbox" name="" id="">I can become impatient with myself if I dont perform well in competition and want improvements in paractive ti happen faster.</li>
					<li><input type="checkbox" name="" id="">I often feel llike my self-esteem is threatened ehen I di not perform up to my own expectations</li>
					<li><input type="checkbox" name="" id="">I care too much about what others think and make assumptions that are not based on reality, such as my parents will not drive me to practice if I dont perform well</li>
					<li><input type="checkbox" name="" id="">I have a fear of letting others down if I dont perform up to their expectations. For example, I wrongly assume that  my team wiill not like me if i lose</li>
					<li><input type="checkbox" name="" id="">I tighten up pr becoome tense in competition and cant perform freely.</li>
					<li><input type="checkbox" name="" id="">I play with too much physical tension and have trouble playing relaxed and free because I try to over-control my movememts or performance</li>
					<li><input type="checkbox" name="" id="">I try to hard to win and this get un my own way mentally with a lack of trust</li>
					<li><input type="checkbox" name="" id="">I try to  be perfect with  my execution and thus get tense, try to over-control my body, or get frustrated when  my game is imperfect.</li>
			</ul>
			</p><p>Assessing your results: 
				if you check yes to 5 or more ststements above its a good bet that fesr of failure hinders your focus in competition and causes a lack of trust. if you checked yes to one or more statements, yo may still need to address this mental game barrier as you may habe at least some perfectionistic tendencies. 
			</p>
