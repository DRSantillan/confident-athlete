			<h3>Day 7 - Warm-up</h3>
			<p>
				You either strive for success will strive to avoid failure and pain,
				what combination of both.One of the signs of fear of failure is an
				athlete and worries too much about making mistakes. If you do this, you
				play to carefully or cautiously. In this mindset, you're trying not to
				lose and try not to make mistakes. The golfer tries not to hit the ball
				in the water. The skater avoids falling on her jobs. The tennis player
				avoids missing the overhead volley. And, so forth.
			</p>
			<p>
				Fear for you to focus on what you don't want to happen. Your performance
				is based on the state of tension, indecision, and carefulness- None of
				which make for optimum performance!
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, a basketball student I work with on his mental game would
				become too careful and cautious after him is the shot early in the game.
				The fear of missing more shots(When you had a good chance to shoot) did
				not allow him to play freely. It would pass the ball instead of taking
				the shot and risking. He was also afraid of getting pulled by the
				courage to be missed another shot.
			</p>
			<p>
				when performing tentatively, your body does not flow. You cannot execute
				your skills the way you treat yourself to do. Worry about mistakes leads
				to a lack of trust, which I'll discuss the detailsin days 10-13

			<h3>Day 7 - Attitude Assessment</h3>
			<p>Please check off the statements that are applicable to you:</p>
			<h4>Mental game assessment</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>
					When I compete, I focus on what I don't want to have happened is that
					what I do want to happen
				</li>

					mistakes
				</li>
				<li>
					I try to be too carefulover control my performance so I don't make
					mistakes and hope of producing a perfect game
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Day 7 - Fearless Strategy</h3>
			<p>
				today's lesson is very important especially if you focus too much on
				mistakes and avoiding mistakes when you perform.You just cannot perform
				fearlessly intention free in this mindset. Start work understand in any
				times where you become tentative and focus too much on what not to
				do.Today's exercise is to determine when you perform in defensive
				mindset. I have included a few examples to help you get started. Check
				of the examples and apply to you...
			</p>
			<p></p>
			<h4>Table 10. Times when I place scared or tentatively</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>
					If I make mistakes early in the game, and avoid making more mistakes
				</li>
				<li>
					if someone I respect is watching me, I want to impress him over
				</li>
				<li>If I play in a tight match game and its crunch time</li>
				<li>if I worry about disappointing my parents, coach, or Team</li>
				<li>if I worry about losing a lead when I am ahead</li>
				<li>
					If my coach is shouting at me telling me not to make any more mistakes
				</li>
				<li>If I worry that my opponent is better than me</li>
				<li>If I feel underprepared or lack confidence due to poor warmUp</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				next the best way to do this is to set small process goals each
				competition. These help you focus on what to do instead of what not to
				do. They used to types of process goals to help athletes focus on what
				to do:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Performance goals: goals based on something you can measure such as
					number of rebound, block shops, or fairways hit the regulation.
				</li>
				<li>
					Mental goals: goals based on your mental game and help you focus on
					one play, shot, or routine at a time, such as committing to a plane or
					visualising your pitch before you start the wind up.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				For more specific information on process goals and concentration
				exercises please refer to the focus athlete section below are a few
				examples of process goals.

			<p>
				One note here. .. I only use process goals to help you become immersed
				in execution in the present moment.Although it's rewarding to reach your
				goals, I don't want you to evaluate would judge whether you are on track
				to reach them. if you do this, you're not focusing on the process you
				are turning into expectations. Goals become expectations when you judge
				and criticise yourself for not reaching your goals.
