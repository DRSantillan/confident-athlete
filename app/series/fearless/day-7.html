				<h3>Day 7 - Warm-up</h3>
				<p>
					You either strive for success will strive to avoid failure and pain,
					what combination of both.One of the signs of fear of failure is an
					athlete and worries too much about making mistakes. If you do this,
					you play to carefully or cautiously. In this mindset, you're trying
					not to lose and try not to make mistakes. The golfer tries not to hit
					the ball in the water. The skater avoids falling on her jobs. The
					tennis player avoids missing the overhead volley. And, so forth.
				</p>
				<p>
					Fear causes you to focus on what you don’t want to happen. Your
					performance is based on a state of tension, indecision, and
					carefulness - none of which make for optimum performance!
				</p>
				<p>
					When performing tentatively, you body does not flow. You cannot
					execute your skills the way you trained yourself to do. Worry about
					mistakes leads to a lack of trust, which I will discuss in detail in
					Days 10-13.

				<h3>Day 7 - Fearless Strategy</h3>
				<p>
					Today’s lesson is very important especially if you focus too much on
					mistakes and avoiding mistakes when you perform. You just cannot
					perform fearlessly and tension-free in this mindset. Start by
					understanding any times where you become tentative or focus too much
					on what not to do. Today’s exercise is to determine when you perform
					in a defensive mindset. I have included a few examples to help you get
					started. Check off the examples that apply to you…
				</p>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Table 10. Times when I place scared or tentatively</h4>
				<div>
					<div class="chkbox">
						<input type="checkbox" value="1" name="q1" id="" />
					</div>
					If I make mistakes early in a game, I avoid making more mistakes.
				</div>
				<div>
					<div class="chkbox">
						<input type="checkbox" value="1" name="q1" id="" />
					</div>
					If someone I respect is watching me, I want to impress him or her.
				</div>
				<div>
					<div class="chkbox">
						<input type="checkbox" value="1" name="q1" id="" />
					</div>
					If I am playing in a tight match or game and it's crunch-time.
				</div>
				<div>
					<div class="chkbox">
						<input type="checkbox" value="1" name="q1" id="" />
					</div>
					If I worry about disappointing my parents, coach, or teammates.
				</div>
				<div>
					<div class="chkbox">
						<input type="checkbox" value="1" name="q1" id="" />
					</div>
					If I worry about losing a lead when I am ahead.
				</div>
				<div>
					<div class="chkbox">
						<input type="checkbox" value="1" name="q1" id="" />
					</div>
					If my coach is shouting at me telling me not make any more mistakes.
				</div>
				<div>
					<div class="chkbox">
						<input type="checkbox" value="1" name="q1" id="" />
					</div>
					If I worry that my opponent is better than me.
				</div>
				<div>
					<div class="chkbox">
						<input type="checkbox" value="1" name="q1" id="" />
					</div>
					If I feel under-prepared or lack confidence due to a poor warm-up.
				</div>

				<p>
					Next, learn how to focus on what is really important to execution. The
					best way to do this is to set small process goals for each
					competition. These help you focus on what TO DO instead of what not to
					do. I use two types of process goals to help athletes focus on what to
					do:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Performance goals:</strong> goals based on something you can
						measure such as number of rebound, block shops, or fairways hit the
						regulation.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Mental goals:</strong> goals based on your mental game and
						help you focus on one play, shot, or routine at a time, such as
						committing to a plane or visualising your pitch before you start the
						wind up.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					For more specific information on process goals and concentration
					exercises please refer to the
					<a href="/series/focused/" target="_blank">focused athlete</a> section
					below are a few examples of process goals.
				</p>

						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>
					One note here… I only use process goals to help you become immersed in
					execution – in the present moment. Although it’s rewarding to reach
					your goals, I don’t want you to evaluate or judge whether you’re on
					track to reach them. If you do this, you are not focusing on the
					process – you are turning them into expectations. Goals become
					expectations when you judge and criticize yourself for not reaching
					your goals.
