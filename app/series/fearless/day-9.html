				<h3>Day 9 - Warm-up</h3>
				<p>
					During mental toughness training, I teach my students about two
					mindsets that contribute to success in tennis. The first this is the
					training or practice mindset. Great at least know the value of
					training.Strive to get better and to improve. they have a tremendous
					amount of motivation and work ethic, which help them to practice hard
					so they can master the skills. How ever, perfectionist that athletes
					typically gets stuck in a training mindset and love to practice and
					perfect technique.
				</p>
				<p>
					the trusting or performance mindset is equally important to success in
					tennis.Trust is your ability to make your skills happen instinctively
					by relying on your practice instead consciously directing your
					movements. performance mindset is the ability to rely on your
					practice, perform freely, and allow your skills to fly without access
					for.When In the trusting mindset you are confident in your skills and
					ability to put your performance on automatic pilot.
				</p>
				<p>
					if you have some perfection is in,You have difficulty entering the
					trusting mindset because of fear and need to have perfect techniqueyou
					want it to feel and look good when you perform, and this limits the
					ability to perform instinctively Or react but you might even get stuck
					in the training mindset and have a hard time accepting limitations and
					mistakes.
				</p>
				<p>
					the bottom lineâ€¦if you're stuck in practice mentality when you
					compete, you will limit your ability to perform Your Best because of
					too much analysis, trying too to hard to be perfect, and a lot of
					trust.

					from the practice mindset
				</p>

				<h3>Day 9 - Fearless Strategy</h3>
				<p>
					The first step is to understand how fear of failure and perfectionism
					sabotage is your ability to perform freely(and fearlessly) in
					competition. let's start with the definition.The performance
					mindset(trust) is your ability to let go of consciously directing your
					body allowing you well and physical skills to happen reflexively based
					on what you had practised.
				</p>
				<p>
					the concept of trust is different from self confidence. Confidence is
					a belief in your ability that healthy play well in competition.
					Trusting your skills and your abilities.Fear of failure can undermine
					trust in many ways:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Perfectionist and mentally trapped in a practice mindset and thus
						have a hard time Performing involuntary in competition
					</li>
					<li>
						perfectionists are afraid to fail and avoid making mistakes and all
						costs even resorting to playing to carefully
					</li>
					<li>
						Performing to carefully or defensively leads you to overcontrol your
						performance for technique; a lack of trust.
					</li>
					<li>
						Since perfectionists think they need to perform the best, you might
						try too hard to be perfect with your game or performance.
					</li>
					<li>
						The fear of making mistakes or disappointing others(fear of negative
						social scrutiny) also easier to news trust and not perform freely in
						competition
					</li>
					<li>
						Thus, fear of failure least trying to be perfect. Trying to be
						perfect causes overcontrol.Over control leave the lack of trust with
						your performance.
					</li>
					<li>
						The cycle continues as you analyse what went wrong, work harder and
						fixing the Errors, and then getting even more fixated in the
						training training mindset.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					< are you able to let it happen in competition?Are you stuck in the
					game of mastering your mechanics and technique and can't play
					fearlessly in competition? Table 13 identify the gap between the
					practice and performance mindsets.
