				<h3>Day 13 - Warm-up</h3>
				<p>
					Up to this point in the workbook, I have discussed how to improve
					trust and perform without fear. In today’s lesson, I want to help you
					understand some important practice strategies that will help you
					easily transition into the fearless performer mindset. As stated,
					perfectionists love to practice and work on weaknesses to the extent
					that practicing can undermine a performance mindset in competition.
					Some athletes are great practice players, but can’t apply their
					practice to competition.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the rules of trust is that you must know the best time to apply
					a training mindset and the best time to apply the performance mindset.
					This means you should also separate your practice into two phases. You
					might dedicate one part of your practice to improving your technique,
					mechanics, method, or working on drills.
				</p>
				<p>
					This helps you transition away from the training mindset into the
					performance mindset. For example, gymnasts do what is called “pressure
					sets” to help them match what happens in meets. Gymnasts use pressure
					sets to simulate the competitive environment when they practice so
					they can feel the same pressure of competition – or at least closer to
					what they will feel in competition. You do not have to use every
					second of practice to do drills to improve technique.
				</p>
				<p>
					A misconception about practice is that you always have to be working
					on technique and mastering perfect mechanics. Your practices should
					include “performing” as well as drilling or training your technique.
					You need to put everything together into a whole performance. For
					example, basketball coaches will structure practice to work on drills
					for lay ups, free-throw technique, dribbling, passing, and defending.
					However, coaches also schedule scrimmages to allow athletes to apply
					the drill work to play. This is why football and basketball teams
					spend a lot of time scrimmaging and not just doing drills.
