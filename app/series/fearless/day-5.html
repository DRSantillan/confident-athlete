				<h3>Day 5 - Warm-up</h3>
				<p>
					My definition of expectation may surprise you. I defined expectations
					are stripped demands or judgements you have about your
					performance.Expectations are not the same as having confidence in your
					ability to perform well such as having confidence in your ability to
					get it or make A lay up. Expectations of the mind you place on your
					performance and cause you to judge how are you doing compared to how
					you think you should be doing.
				</p>
				<p>
					What the difference is between expectation and confidence? Confidence
					is simply a belief in your ability such as I believe I can get hit and
					advance runner on first base.But this is not a diet need when talking
					about confidence – Earlier believe in ability to do this. expectation
					is more absolute and judgemental.Expectation of that comes with added
					pressure. added pressure can cause perfectionists to try harder, such
					as, I must get naked for my coaching team as they expect me to get on
					base.Expectations in confidence and different concept, but I'll very
					important to understand in helping you play fearlessly.
				</p>
				<p>
					Fear of failure is lifted expectations when you worry too much about
					not achieving your own expectations all your perceived expectations
					that others may have for you.For example, specific expectations about
					what school you should achieve places and wanted pressure on attaining
					a specific school. The outcome is a fear of not attaining your school
					and the mindset of avoiding mistakes at all costs.
				</p>
				<p>
					Having a strict, perfectionist all unrealistic expectations can
					determine your sports confidence. This is especially true when you
					feel that you are not meeting your own performers
					expectations.Essentially, high expectations set you up for failure
					before you give a competition.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition, expectations are usually about results such as obtaining
					a specific school or achieving personal statistic such as batting
					average.Judge yourself or your game based on these expectations.You
					then focus too much on outcomes, schools, or sister thinks which
					distract you from focusing on the process of execution. your goal is
					to identify and replace result expectations with simple goals that
					focus on execution.

				</p>

				<h3>Day 5 - Fearless Strategy</h3>
				<p>
					If you are familiar with my workyou may well know one of my formulas
					for success in sports. My formula is to identify a replacement
					expectations with high confidence and manageable balls the very first
					step is to flush out the expectations that cause you to pressure
					yourselfOr worry too much about results.
				</p>
				<p>
					below are questions that help you identify strict expectations that
					underlie perfectionism in fear of failure:
				</p>
				<h4></h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						do your goals for a competition focus on outcomes for results
						only?(expectations can often be the skies as goals.)
					</li>
					<li>
						do you constantly judge the level of your performance based on your
						personal standards?
					</li>
					<li>
						Do you become upset when you did not perform up to your own set of
						standards?
					</li>
					<li>
						do you lose confidence when you do not play to your personal
						standards?
					</li>
					<li>
						Do you maintain expectations about the quality of your performance
						at the start of a competition such as expecting to make zero
						mistakes?
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					how do expectations cause you to feel more pressure and try
					harder?Let's look at a few examples from my students
				</p>
				<h5>
					Examples of expectations that imply greater pressure and more trying
					my athletes:
				</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Golf: 'I need to strike the ball perfectly today to play my best.'
					</li>
					<li>
						tennis:'I can't make any errors against my brother today or I will
						lose.'
					</li>
					<li>
						Autoracing: my team can't make any mistakes today if we want to win
					</li>
					<li>
						Football: I have to execute my passes with perfect techniques under
						the receiver will catch that
					</li>
					<li>
						Gymnastics: I must control my performance and stick my landing to
						school well today on my routine
					</li>
					<li>
						Basketball: if I don't make 15 assists today at 10 rebound I haven't
						performed up to my ability
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>List your expectations based on the example above call</p>
				<ul>
					<li><input type="text" name="" id="" /></li>
					<li><input type="text" name="" id="" /></li>
					<li><input type="text" name="" id="" /></li>
					<li><input type="text" name="" id="" /></li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					your goal should be to play without any expectations, good or bad.
					Your expectations set you up for failure and only cause you to judge
					how well you are doing is it alternative,You should replace
					expectations with a feeling of confidence.I will give you an example
					of how this works.
