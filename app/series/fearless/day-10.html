			<h3>Day 10 - Warm-up</h3>
			<p>
				Perfectionistic or super motivated athletes who love to train are the
				athletes who have trouble trusting their technique and performing
				fearlessly in competition. Perfectionists strive to look good on the
				playing fields. They want their performance to feel correct, technique
				to look good, and also get the correct results when they perform. I call
				this a "triple threat." If one of there areas are not perfect, you might
				become upset or over-analyze what went wrong.
			</p>
			<p>
				Focusing too much on technique, looking good, or feeling correct
				prevents perfectionists from focusing on the real objective in sports -
				to win or get the job done efficiently as possible. When you are worried
				about how your game looks/feels , or desire to obtain perfect results,
				it is hard to play with freedom and a quiet mind.
			</p>
			<p>
				I teach my students how to let go of the trying mindset and get into the
				flow mindset in competition by separating the practice athlete from the
				performer. This is the only way to find out if your technique is good
				enough.
			</p>

			<h3>Day 10 - Fearless Strategy</h3>
			<p>
				When I talk to my students about the practice and performance mindsets
				and learning to let if flow, I discuss the opposite of trust - over
				control. This helps you understand just how you sabotage your own trust.
				Table 14 below describes the top mental game breakdowns that sabotage
				your trust in competition.
