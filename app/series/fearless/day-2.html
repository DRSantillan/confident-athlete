		<h1>Day two–How perfectionism in stills fear of failure</h1>
		<h2>Warm up</h2>
		<p>
			I work with many athletes who have a perfectionist the behaviours or
			tendencies. I don't know why this is...Do some sports instilled
			perfectionism? some traits of perfectionism are very helpful to improving
			your performance as I discussed in day three. However my experience shows
			that fear of failure is closely related to perfectionism in sports.Athlete
			to a perfectionistic(and highly motivated) do not perform up to their
			potential because of fear of failure.Why? Since perfectionists are so
			highly motivated off and have lofty goals for themselves,This causes a
			strong need to win will succeed in sports. however,The hallmark side of
			perfectionism in sports is that perfectionists(fearful athletes)Spend a
			lot of time training and practising to become successful, but often
			underperforming competition.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is ironic that the athlete to want to win the most, a train the most
			are often those who are the most likely to be mentally stuck in fear of
			failure. perfectionistic athletes often lose sight of the real golden
			sports–To use training to perform well in competition. they become so
			engrossed in training and practice that perfecting their technique or
			working hard in practice becomes a primary goal instead of performing with
			confidence in competition.And when they do compete, they believe in
			anything but perfect execution or winning is deemed as failure.
