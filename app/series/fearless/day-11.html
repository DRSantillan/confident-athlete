				<h3>Day 11 - Warm-up</h3>
				<p>
					You probably spend too much time in a practice or training mindset as
					discussed in the previous lesson. Therefore, one of your priorities is
					to learn how to stay confident and in control of yourself when your
					performance is not perfect or when you do not have your A game. An
					important lesson I teach my students is to learn how to perform
					efficiently instead of perfectly. I call this a “functional mindset.”
				</p>
				<p>
					A functional mindset is the opposite of trying to make everything
					perfect. It starts with the idea that you DO NOT have to be perfect to
					perform your best. You are human and humans can’t be perfect. You will
					make mistakes and you have to accept mistakes. Tennis coach to
					professional players, Brad Gilbert, calls the functional mindset
					“winning ugly,” which he wrote a book about.
				</p>
				<p>
					In golf, for example, winning ugly is called scrambling. A golfer
					finds a way to get the ball in the hole without regard for “the proper
					way.” In today’s lesson, you will learn how to adopt the functional
					mindset so you can play efficiently and get the job done in
					competition.

					worrying that your performance in not perfect.

				<h3>Day 11 - Fearless Strategy</h3>
				<p>
					The following are the top six strategies to helping you perform in a
					functional mindset and win ugly.
				</p>
				<p></p>
				<h4></h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong
							>Strive for perfection in practice, but accept that you cannot be
							perfect with your performance.</strong
						>
						It’s irrational to think you can be perfect with your performance.
						You can strive for perfection in your practice, but you have to
						accept errors as a natural part of sports, and part of being human.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong
							>Give yourself permission to make errors when performing.</strong
						>
						I don’t want you to expect that you will make errors, but you
						certainly must accept them when you commit errors. Give yourself the
						luxury of making 3-4 errors for each performance so you can play on
						in a functional mindset.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Perform efficiently instead of perfectly.</strong> This
						means that you have to abandon the “correct” way to perform in some
						cases. Use whatever works to help you get the job done in
						competition. For example, instead of needing to execute a play
						exactly from the playbook, be happy with a play that worked well,
						but maybe was not “textbook” execution.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Simplify how you perform.</strong> This is the opposite of
						trying to be perfect. Simplicity means using fewer thoughts to
						perform, reacting more, and NOT thinking about every single
						instruction your coach has told you. Don’t “overcoach” yourself, in
						other words. Less is always better.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Perform a task that you know you can perform well.</strong>
						Stick to your “bread and butter” play, shot, or routine. For
						example, I teach my golf students to play the shot that’s currently
						working well instead of the fancy or perfect shot.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Save practice for after the competition.</strong> Avoid
						analyzing your mistakes and trying to fix or correct your technique
						in the middle of a game or performance.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					Using Table 15 below, your task is to devise a sports-specific plan
					for how to put your new functional mindset into action. For example,
					in a functional mindset where mistakes are only temporary road blocks,
					your plan could be to give yourself the luxury of making 3 mistakes
					for each competition.
				</p>
