				<h3>Day 11 - Warm-up</h3>
				<p>
					You probably spend too much time in a practice or training mindset as
					discussed in the previous lesson. Therefore, one of your priorities is
					to learn how to stay confident and in control of yourself when your
					performance is not perfect or when you do not have your A game. An
					important lesson I teach my students is to learn how to perform
					efficiently instead of perfectly. I call this a "functional mindset."
					When you are in a functional mindset, you are more flexible mentally
					and can easily adapt to a less than optimal performance (when you are
					not perfect).
				</p>
				<p>
					A functional mindset is the opposite of trying to make everything
					perfect. It starts with the idea that you DO NOT have to be perfect to
					perform your best. You are human and humans can't be perfect. You will
					make mistakes and you have to accept mistakes. Tennis coach to
					professional players, Brad Gilbert, calls the functional mindset
					"winning ugly," which he wrote a book about.
				</p>
				<p>
					Winning ugly is the idea that you get the job done and perform
					efficiently. Brad Gilbert (1993) says, "I've used whatever skills I do
					have in a calculated way that maximizes potential; that gives me my
					best chance to win. It's why I've been able to beat players who are
					supposedly 'better' than me. You can do the same. Make the most of
					what you've got."
				</p>
				<p>
					In golf, for example, winning ugly is called scrambling. A golfer
					finds a way to get the ball in the hole without regard for "the proper
					way." In today's lesson, you will learn how to adopt the functional
					mindset so you can play efficiently and get the job done in
					competition.

				<h3>Day 11 - Fearless Strategy</h3>
				<p>
					The following other toxic strategies to helping you perform in a
					functional mindset and we ugly
				</p>
				<p></p>
				<h4></h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						strive for perfection in practice, but except that you cannot be
						perfect with your performance. it's irrational to think you can be
						perfect with your performance. You could strive for perfection in
						your practice, but you have to accept errors as a natural part of
						tennis, and part of being human.
					</li>
					<li>
						Give yourself permission to make errors were performing. I don't
						want you to expect that you will make errors, but you certainly must
						accept them when you commit errors.Give yourself the luxury of
						making 3 to 4 errors what is performance so you can play on in a
						functional mindset
					</li>
					<li>
						Before efficiently instead of perfectly. This means that you have to
						abandon the correct way to perform in some cases.Use whatever works
						to help you get the job done in competition. or example, instead of
						needing to execute a play exactly from the Bible, be happy with the
						play that worked well, but maybe was not textbook execution.
					</li>
					<li>
						Simplify how you perform. this is the opposite of trying to be
						perfect.Simplicity means using fewer thoughts to perform, reacting
						more, and not thinking about every single instruction your coaches
						told you. don't Overcoach yourself, other words. Less is always
						better.
					</li>
					<li>
						perform a task that you know you can perform well.Stick to your
						bread and butter play, shot, or routine.For example, I teach my golf
						students to play the shot that is currently working well instead of
						the Fancy or perfect shop
					</li>
					<li>
						Save practice for after the competition. avoid analysing your
						mistakes and trying to fix or correct Your technique in the middle
						of a game or performance.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					using table 15 below, your task is to devise a sport specific plan for
					how to put your new functional mindset into action. Four example, in a
					functional mindset when mistakes are only temporary roadblocks, you're
					playing good beat to give yourself the luxury of making three mistakes
					from each competition.
				</p>
