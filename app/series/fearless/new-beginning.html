					Congratulations! Way to go! You should pat yourself on the back for
					completing The Fearless Athlete program. The new, fearless you is on
					your way to unbeatable trust. You should be proud of yourself for
					taking action with your mental game and recognizing that you can
					improve your attitude and mental toughness. You will be rewarded for
					taking action to improve your mental game! Now for the real fun part…
				</p>
				<p>
					I need you to take fearless action now! You are armed with the
					powerful mental strategies and tools to help you remove fear, focus on
					success, and improve your trust, which is an excellent first step!
					But, this is just the beginning to rocket you to unbeatable trust! THE
					most important objective is to use the lessons in this workbook and CD
					program and apply them daily to your practice and play! This is
					critical to achieving peak performance…
				</p>
				<p>
					I make sure all my students understand that learning any skills,
					especially mental game skills, requires three steps. The first part is
					the ability to understand the mental strategies that will help improve
					your mental game. The second stage is the ability to apply your mental
					strategies to your sport daily. The third and final stage is your
					ability to commit, over the long term – months and months, to improve
					your trust, confidence, and mental attitude. Learning is never
					complete without the diligence to stay committed to your mental
					training program.
				</p>
				<p>
					My suggestion is to review The Fearless Athlete at least once a month
					and more often if necessary. Use the “Assess Your Progress” sections
					at the end of each session to help you identify areas to improve and
					track your progress. On the following page, I have included a summary
					of the action plans for each day of the 14-day program that will help
					you do a quick review of the program. Remove this page from your
					workbook and post it where you can see it every day. You should review
					these action plans often and work daily to apply 1-2 of the concepts
					to your practice, training, and competition! On the following page,
					you will find the final Taking Fearless Action commitment contract
					that you should review and sign now. Warning: if you sign the
					contract, be prepared to take massive action!
