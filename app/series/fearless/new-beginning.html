				Congratulations! Way to go! You should pat yourself on the back for
				completing The Fearless Athlete program. The new, fearless you is on
				your way to unbeatable trust. You should be proud of yourself for taking
				action with your mental game and recognizing that you can improve your
				attitude and mental toughness. You will be rewarded for taking action to
				improve your mental game! Now for the real fun part…
			</p>
			<p>
				I need you to take fearless action now! You are armed with the powerful
				mental strategies and tools to help you remove fear, focus on success,
				and improve your trust, which is an excellent first step! But, this is
				just the beginning to rocket you to unbeatable trust! THE most important
				objective is to use the lessons in this workbook and CD program and
				apply them daily to your practice and play! This is critical to
				achieving peak performance…
			</p>
			<p>
				I make sure all my students understand that learning any skills,
				especially mental game skills, requires three steps. The first part is
				the ability to understand the mental strategies that will help improve
				your mental game. The second stage is the ability to apply your mental
				strategies to your sport daily. The third and final stage is your
				ability to commit, over the long term – months and months, to improve
				your trust, confidence, and mental attitude. Learning is never complete
				without the diligence to stay committed to your mental training program.
			</p>
			<p>
				My suggestion is to review The Fearless Athlete at least once a month
				and more often if necessary. Use the “Assess Your Progress” sections at
				the end of each session to help you identify areas to improve and track
				your progress. On the following page, I have included a summary of the
				action plans for each day of the 14-day program that will help you do a
				quick review of the program. Remove this page from your workbook and
				post it where you can see it every day. You should review these action
				plans often and work daily to apply 1-2 of the concepts to your
				practice, training, and competition! On the following page, you will
				find the final Taking Fearless Action commitment contract that you
				should review and sign now. Warning: if you sign the contract, be
				prepared to take massive action!
