				<h3>
					Welcome to The Fearless Athlete: A 14-day Plan for Unbeatable Trust.
				</h3>
				<p>
					Fear of failure and perfectionism is so prevalent in my work with
					athletes that it is becoming rampant in athletics. What you may not
					know or understand is that athletes with fear of failure are highly
					motivated individuals who want badly to succeed and reach their goals.
					Perfectionists are incredibly motivated to improve and succeed. But
					this very positive mindset to use in practice can actually hinder them
					and undermine perfectionists from reaching peak performance in sports.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Fearless Athlete teaches you the same strategies I teach my
					personal coaching students when working with athletes in the area of
					fear of failure, perfectionism, and trust in sports. By the end of
					this 14-day program, you will have learned the key mental strategies
					to help you perform with freedom, fearlessness, and unbeatable trust
					in virtually any competitive situation!
				</p>
				<p>
					Many of the athletes I work with focus too much on having the perfect
					performance or fixate on how they will appear to others (such as
					teammates, parents, coaches) when performing. This hidden need to
					execute flawlessly or to look good in competition undermines
					performance during competitive situations. In this workbook, you will
					be asked to look honestly at yourself to discover the beliefs and
					attitudes that keep you stuck in a comfort zone (or a certain
					performance level) and hold you back from reaching your goals.
				</p>
				<p>
					Throughout the next 14 days of this workbook, I will present many
					self-awareness exercises to help you pinpoint your own fears and
					attitudes that block your success. Are you ready to learn unbeatable
					trust? Great! Letâ€™s get started right now!
				</p>

				<h3>How to use this program</h3>
				<p>
					Each day you will be given specific tasks to complete to identify
					mental barriers and improve your mental game. At times you will be
					given awareness exercises to help you identify mindsets that undermine
					or alternately, contribute to success in sports. At the end of 14
					days, you will be well on your way to unbeatable trust.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each day of the program is divided into daily tasks which you need to
					complete. For maximum benefit from each Daily Fearless Strategy, you
					should complete all the tasks, starting with Day 1 and work your way
					to Day 14. You may choose to complete the workbook/audio in 7 days if
					you do 2 days at a time.
				</p>
				<p>
					Use the audio program that accompanies The Fearless Athlete to help
					guide you through the program. For example, open the workbook to Day 1
					and listen to the audio for Day 1. After you complete the audio for
					Day 1, stop and complete the workbook exercises for Day 1 before
					proceeding to Day 2 audio. The table, below, is a description of the
					daily tasks you will complete in each section to enhance your focus.
