			<h3>Day 3 - Warm-up</h3>
			<p>
				Many perfectionist the athletes, coaches, and sport parents don't
				understand how tried to be perfect and competitioncan reduce the chance
				of being successful in tennis. After all humans are led to believe that
				we should strive to be perfect.However, striving for perfection is not
				the same as expecting perfection.For perfectionistic athletes, there is
				not a clear line between striding toward in practice and expecting
				perfection in competition,Which is likely to fear of failure.
			</p>
			<p>
				Perfectionism is a necessarily About quality. Some of the qualities of
				perfectionists are very functional to performance. for example,A strong
				work ethic, commitment two goals, and having a desire to learn and
				improve a very positive characteristics that all athletes should
				embrace. Perfectionists are often very motivated and this helps them
				want to train harder than anyone to become successful.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, perfectionist traits become a problem when they negatively
				impact performance and hinder success.The biggest challenge with
				perfectionism comes down to how you handle competitive environments. if
				you try to be perfect competition,You sanitised your ability to perform.
				although trying to be perfect may sound logical, it is
				counter-productive to the performance of your motor skills and causes
				you to lose self trust(the concept I will cover the details later in
				this workbook).
			</p>
			<p>
				The downside of perfectionism is that you harbour strict expectations
				about your performance, are afraid of failing,You worry too much about
				results such as personal gangster statistics or winning. moreover, in my
				experience, I found it difficult to convince perfectionists that is
				straight hold them back in sports.Some of my students resist changing
				their behaviour because it has, in part, help them achieve some rather
				lofty goals.
			</p>
			<p>
				One pitfall of perfectionism is harbouring high expectations of your
				performance, which feeding to get more problems.When you don't achieve
				your expectations, it is easy feel frustrated and feel as if you are
				Failing. You might think too much about outcomes such as sports as
				statistics and this causes anxiety and worry about failing. The end
				result is that you ultimately conform at a less level then your full
				potential.This leads to a variety of other problems such as confidence,
				composure and focus issues
