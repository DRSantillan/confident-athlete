				<h3>Day 3 - Warm-up</h3>
				<p>
					Many perfectionist the athletes, coaches, and sport parents don't
					understand how tried to be perfect and competitioncan reduce the
					chance of being successful in tennis. After all humans are led to
					believe that we should strive to be perfect.However, striving for
					perfection is not the same as expecting perfection. For
					perfectionistic athletes, there is not a clear line between striding
					toward in practice and <strong>expecting perfection</strong> in
					competition, which is likely to fear of failure.
				</p>
				<p>
					Perfectionism is a necessarily About quality. Some of the qualities of
					perfectionists are very functional to performance. For example, a
					strong work ethic, commitment two goals, and having a desire to learn
					and improve a very positive characteristics that all athletes should
					embrace. Perfectionists are often very motivated and this helps them
					want to train harder than anyone to become successful.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, perfectionist traits become a problem when they negatively
					impact performance and hinder success.The biggest challenge with
					perfectionism comes down to how you handle competitive environments.
					If you try to be perfect competition,You sanitised your ability to
					perform. although trying to be perfect may sound logical, it is
					counter-productive to the performance of your motor skills and causes
					you to lose self trust(the concept I will cover the details later in
					this workbook).
				</p>
				<p>
					The downside of perfectionism is that you harbour strict expectations
					about your performance, are afraid of failing,You worry too much about
					results such as personal gangster statistics or winning. moreover, in
					my experience, I found it difficult to convince perfectionists that is
					straight hold them back in sports.Some of my students resist changing
					their behaviour because it has, in part, help them achieve some rather
					lofty goals.
				</p>
				<p>
					One pitfall of perfectionism is harbouring high expectations of your
					performance, which feeding to get more problems.When you don't achieve
					your expectations, it is easy feel frustrated and feel as if you are
					failing. You might think too much about outcomes such as sports as
					statistics and this causes anxiety and worry about failing. The end
					result is that you ultimately conform at a less level then your full
					potential.This leads to a variety of other problems such as
					confidence, composure and focus issues

				<h3>Day 3 - Fearless Strategy</h3>
				<p>
					Being a perfectionist is not all bad. Some behaviors are very
					functional and actually helpful to your success in sports and life!
				</p>
				<p>
					So the first step is to identify what behaviors are helpful and
					promote those traits by keeping them in action! But you also need to
					identify the behaviors that cause you to feel anxiety, tension, fear,
					or try too hard in sports, as these behaviors lead to problems in
					competition.

					Table 4 helps you identify the mindsets that are functional and
					non-functional to your performance
