				<h3>Day 12 - Warm-up</h3>
				<p>
					many athletes train all year around. Ins some sports, such as skating,
					an athlete will spend months of trainin for one major competition of
					the year. skaters spend 95% of practive time in the training mindset.
					as discussed in previous lessons, too m uch of just thetraining
					mindset makes it difficult to transition into the performance mindset
					when competition time comes around.
				</p>
				<p>
					In other sports like golf, perfectionists can become enamored with
					their gold swing or technique. They spend most of their practice time
					on the practive tee working to improve mechanics of the swing and very
					lettle time playing on the course. This scenario also makes it
					difficult for the golfer to transition to the performer mindset in
					competition. These golfers look like stars in practice, but hackers on
					the course.
				</p>
				<p>
					One goal of the The Fearless Athlete is to help you perform
					fearlessly, without the mental traps of trying to be perfect or the
					fear of making mistakes. You have to learn how to play on "instinct",
					win ugly, perform without over-control or excess tension in
					competition to allow your true abilities to shine. Now you know what
					trust is and how you sabotage your own trust. You also learned the
					situations and mindsets that contrubute to a mental game that avoids
					mistakes. The final step of the fearless athlete is to learn mental
					strategies that help you transform into the performer mindset in
					competition.

				<h5>My plan for unbeatable trust</h5>
				<p>
					Lets set up your plan for unbeatable trust using the following 6
					strategies. Your job is to make each strategy specific to your sport.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>Focus on what you want to have happen</p>
						<p>
							*Runner example: I want to be with the runners in the front pack
							at the half way mark.
						</p>
						<p>My sports specific task:</p>
						<p><input type="text" name="" id="" /></p>
						<p>
							Taper your training as you approach competition so yu can get into
							the competitive mindset.
						</p>
						<p>
							*basebal example: 2 days before a game I will stop working on my
							swing in the batting cage and instead see the ball and react.
						</p>
						<p>My sports specific task:</p>
						<p><input type="text" name="" id="" /></p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>2. KNow when to train and when to perform</p>
						<p>Train your game during practice.</p>
						<p>
							* Golf example: I will train swing mechanics only when on the
							practice tee.
						</p>
						<p>My sports specific task:</p>
						<p><input type="text" name="" id="" /></p>
						<p>
							Be a performer in competition.
						</p>
						<p>
							*golf example: When I am over the ball in competition I will use
							one simple swing cue or thought to execute shots.
						</p>
						<p>My sports specific task:</p>
						<p><input type="text" name="" id="" /></p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>3. Simplify my performance</p>
						<p>Focus on only one "cue" at a time while performing.</p>
						<p>
							*Tennis example: When serving, I will only focus on the target
							area in the service court when I want the ball to land
						</p>
						<p>My sports specific task:</p>
						<p><input type="text" name="" id="" /></p>
						<p>
							Use images and feelings instead of instructing yourself with
							verbal commands.
						</p>
						<p>
							*Tennis example: I will focus on the feeling proper tempo or
							balance when hitting my serves.
						</p>
						<p>My sports specific task:</p>
						<p><input type="text" name="" id="" /></p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>4. Perform freer and less serious</p>
						<p>Dont treat tour sport as a "life or death" situation.</p>
						<p>
							*Baseball example: I will stay calm and composed at-bat and not
							worry about getting a hit.
						</p>
						<p>My sports specific task:</p>
						<p><input type="text" name="" id="" /></p>
						<p>strive to try less, play on instinct, and let it happen.</p>
						<p>
							*baseball example: Seeing the ball and reacting quickly is my goal
							at-bat. I will not make it over-complicated.
						</p>
						<p>My sports specific task:</p>
						<p><input type="text" name="" id="" /></p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Be committed</p>
						<p>
							Be fully committed to your decisions such as race plan, game
							strategy, shot plan etc.
						</p>
						<p>
							*Motocross example: I will execute my race plan to ride smooth
							with effortless speed regardless of my position in the race.
						</p>
						<p>My sports specific task:</p>
						<p><input type="text" name="" id="" /></p>
						<p>
							Increase decisiveness to increase trust - dont be wishy washy.
						</p>
						<p>
							*Motocross example: On corners, I will stick with the plan and not
							deviate from it.
						</p>
