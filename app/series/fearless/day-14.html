			<h3>Day 14 - Warm-up</h3>
			<p>
				when I discuss balance with my students I use a simple, but important
				motto: "Leave sports on the playing field after you leave the court".
				Can tou forget about your performance after you leave the playing field,
				court or court? do you get frustrated when perform poorly that you take
				the feeling of disappointment home with you? And the very next day you
				are back aat practice and think you need to give more effort and
				preactice harder? Finally, does how well you play on a given day
				determine how you feel about yourself after you go home? Are you upset
				for a long time or can you leave it on the court?
			</p>
			<p>
				Athletes who care deeply about sports success and who spend a lit of
				time in practice or training, such as tennis, for example, often wrongly
				define themselves through their sport. They believe that their level of
				success(as an Athlete) defines them as a person. these athletes live and
				die with every performance. After a poor performance, they feel like a
				failure.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you win or perform well, do you feel better about yourself as a
				person? And if you lose or perform poorly, do you get upset, frustrated,
				and cannnot stand to look into the mirror when you get home? Sadly I
				hear these statements a lot.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you train all day long, every day or take a 24/7 approach to your
				tennis training, you might be the type of athlete who defines yourself
				through sports.

			<h3>Day 14 - Objective</h3>
			<p>
				The goal of todays lesson is to help you find greater balance in your
				life and to learn how to leave your performance on the tennis court
				after the game.

			<h3>Day 14 - Fearless Strategy</h3>
			<p>
				The first step to creating balance in your life is to understand that
				your are person and not just an athlete. You arfe not and "athlete" who
				happens also to be a pwerson. You also happen to play tennis. This can
				be a revelation for many athletes who used to defining themselves as an
				athlete
			</p>
			<p>
				Let's begin by defining the other "roles" in your life(other pursuits
				and areas of your life beyond tennis). Your other roles can include
				student, business person, son, friend, hobbyist and so on. What are the
				roles you have in your life? List them below.
			</p>
			<h4>Other roles in my life:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>1</li>
				<li>2</li>
				<li>3</li>
				<li>4</li>
				<li>5</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				If your life is all about tennis, you are at greater risk for
				self-esteem problems because your define yourself based on your level of
				success in tennis and cant seperate the different roles in your life.
				Your goal is to strive to find a balance in your life with family,
				school, spoerts, friends, hobbies and other career aspirations.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Become a Magician at "Role Playing"</strong> When you are
					playing tennis, involve yourself in that role - ccommit to 8 hours of
					practice or playing a day if thats what it takes, but when you leave
					the tennis court, switch roles and fully commit to other areas of your
					life. Dont superimpose the role of athlete onto other areas of life.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Define Your Self-Concept Outside of Sports</strong>To help you
					become a magician at changing roles, you must first define whou you
					are outside tennis(use appendix 1 to help you with this task.) Use
					only descriptions that apply to your personal characteristics that you
					bring to every aspect of your life. Make a list of these positive
					characteristics and review them every day. Know who the person inside
					is!
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Dont take it home with you.</strong>Leave tennis on the court.
					I know this one will be hard to do. At the very least, designate one
					or two hours of family or recreation time. Everyone needs a break.
					Leaving it on the court is especially important when you did not
					perform up to your ability. In addition, your family will appreciate
					you if you dont bring home the negative emotions.
