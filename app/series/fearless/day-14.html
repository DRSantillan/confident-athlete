				<h3>Day 14 - Warm-up</h3>
				<p>
					When I discuss balance with my students I use a simple, but important
					motto: “Leave sports on the playing field after you leave the arena.”
					Can you forget about your performance after you leave the playing
					field, court, track, or course? Do you get so frustrated when you
					perform poorly that you take the feeling of disappointment home with
					you? And the very next day you are back at practice and think you need
					to give more effort and practice harder? Finally, does how well you
					play on a given day determine how you feel about yourself after you go
					home? Are you upset for a long time or can you leave it on the playing
					field?
				</p>
				<p>
					Athletes who care deeply about sports success and who spend a lot of
					time in practice or training, such as golfers, skaters, swimmers, and
					gymnasts, for example, often wrongly define themselves through their
					sport. They believe that their level of success (as an athlete)
					defines them as a person. These athletes live and die with every
					performance. After a poor performance, they feel like a failure.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you win or perform well, do you feel better about yourself as a
					person? And if you lose or perform poorly, do you get upset,
					frustrated, and can’t stand to look into the mirror when you get home?
					Sadly I hear these statements a lot!
				</p>
				<p>
					If you train all day long, every day or take a 24/7 approach to your
					sport training, you might be the type of athlete who defines yourself
					through sports.

				<h3>Day 14 - Objective</h3>

					The goal of today’s lesson is to help you find greater balance in your

				<h3>Day 14 - Fearless Strategy</h3>
				<p>
					The first step to creating balance in your life is to understand that
					you are person and not just an athlete. You are not an “athlete” who
					happens also to be a person. You also happen to play sports. This can
					be a revelation for many athletes who are used to defining themselves
					as an athlete.
				</p>
				<p>
					Let’s begin by defining the other “roles” in your life (other pursuits
					and areas of your life beyond sports). Your other roles can include
					student, businessperson, son or daughter, friend, wife or husband,
					father or mother, hobbyist, and so on. What are the other roles you
					have in your life? List at least five below.
				</p>
				<h4>Other Roles in my Life:</h4>
				<div class="container">
					<div class="container__row">
						<div class="container__col">
							<input
								class="txt-input"
								type="text"
								name=""
								id=""
								placeholder="Role..."
							/>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="container__row">
						<div class="container__col">
							<input
								class="txt-input"
								type="text"
								name=""
								id=""
								placeholder="Role..."
							/>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="container__row">
						<div class="container__col">
							<input
								class="txt-input"
								type="text"
								name=""
								id=""
								placeholder="Role..."
							/>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="container__row">
						<div class="container__col">
							<input
								class="txt-input"
								type="text"
								name=""
								id=""
								placeholder="Role..."
							/>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="container__row">
						<div class="container__col">
							<input
								class="txt-input"
								type="text"
								name=""
								id=""
								placeholder="Role..."
							/>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>
					If your life is all about sport, you are at greater risk for
					self-esteem problems because you define yourself based on your level
					of success in sports and can’t separate the different roles in your
					life. You goal is to strive to find a balance in your life with
					family, school, sports, friends, hobbies, and other career
					aspirations.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<strong>Become a Magician at "Role Playing"</strong> When you are
						playing tennis, involve yourself in that role - ccommit to 8 hours
						of practice or playing a day if thats what it takes, but when you
						leave the tennis court, switch roles and fully commit to other areas
						of your life. Dont superimpose the role of athlete onto other areas
						of life.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Define Your Self-Concept Outside of Sports</strong>To help
						you become a magician at changing roles, you must first define whou
						you are outside tennis(use appendix 1 to help you with this task.)
						Use only descriptions that apply to your personal characteristics
						that you bring to every aspect of your life. Make a list of these
						positive characteristics and review them every day. Know who the
						person inside is!
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Dont take it home with you.</strong>Leave tennis on the
						court. I know this one will be hard to do. At the very least,
						designate one or two hours of family or recreation time. Everyone
						needs a break. Leaving it on the court is especially important when
						you did not perform up to your ability. In addition, your family
						will appreciate you if you dont bring home the negative emotions.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong> for Balance in your life.</strong> Success is what you
						define it to be. When I see athletes who have 24/7 involvement in
						their sport, I suggest that they find other hobbies, interests, or
						goals to occupy their time when not performing or practicing. Have
						you considered any hobbies that you were afraid to start because of
						the time demands of your sport? Do you have other career interests
						that you could spend a couple hours a week pursuing?
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong
							>List at least five other recreational activities, family
							gatherings, educational endeavors or career pursuits</strong
						>
						you enjoy doing on your free time. Make it a priority to involve
						yourself in these pursuits when not participating in sports:

							<div class="container__row">

									<input
										class="txt-input"

							</div>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Others will not judge you on success in sports.</strong>
						Your immediate family and true friends love you for who you are as a
						person first. They don’t make judgments based on your win-loss
						record or change their view of you if you win or lose a game. Your
						true friends enjoy your company for what you bring to a relationship
						as a person, not as a successful athlete.
