				<h3>Day 4 - Warm-up</h3>
				<p>
					The very first stepis to identify the beliefs, attitudes, and
					expectations that cause you to hold onto your over exactly is in
					competition and lead to the fear of failure. You want to keep the
					positive aspects of your mental game such as your motivation and
					commitment to tennis. However,You Maslow likely maintained beliefs and
					chips that support of fearful, cautious, or over seriousness attitude
					when performing, such as "I must be perfect if I want to win today" or
					'I must analyse my mistakes and fix them right away so I don't make
					the same mistake' This may sound good, but actually hinder your
					ability to play well.
				</p>
				<p>
					these Behaviours(what I call core beliefs or attitudes) Govern your
					non-functional perfectionistic thinking in competition and help to
					keep you stuck. For example, Perfectionistic athletes think that they
					must perform perfectly(mistake three) In competition to win or perform
					their best. Your beliefs are often about expectations you have about
					the quality of your performance
				</p>
				<p>
					most of your expectations,Especially Perfectionistic Ones do not help
					you perform freely in the present moment. expectations and
					non-functional attitudes are often formed because of your past
					experience, coaching, and upbringing. Today, I want to help you
					uncover any beliefs that are causing you to stay stuck in a
					non-functional mindset.

				<h3>Day 4 - Attitude Assessment</h3>
				<p>Please check off the statements that are applicable to you:</p>
				<h4>Mental game assessment</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						I try to be too exact and precise so that I will perform to the best
						of my ability
					</li>
					<li>
						I expected perform with perfection and thus limit my ability to
						perform freely and in the present moment
					</li>
					<li>
						I try to have a mistake free performance the competition but often
						feel like I never achieve perfect performance
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section class="objective">
				<h3>Day 4 - Objective</h3>
				<p>

					performance support non-functional perfectionistic thinking in
					competition, and to help you identify these beliefs.
				</p>

				<h3>Day 4 - Fearless Strategy</h3>
				<p>
					sometimes the truth hurts.However, having one or two perfectionist
					that believes in your sport does not label you as a perfectionist.
					goal of today's exercise is to help you undercover police and sabotage
					your performance in competition and practice.You will need to take an
					honest look at your mental game to uncover the top ineffective beliefs
					I have listed in table 5. This is not an exhaustive list, but are the
					most common ones at least identify when I'm working with them.
				</p>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Table 5 Top non-functional believes in attitude</h4>
				<h4>Ineffective belief</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						I should demand high expectations of myself because I worked so hard
						for my goals
					</li>
					<li>It is impossible for me to work too much or too hard</li>
					<li>
						ISS my performance as either good or bad with no middle ground(Wall
						or non-thinking)
					</li>
					<li>
						if they play is not perfect today, I must analyse it and fix it
						right away
					</li>
					<li>I must control my performance for the way I want</li>
					<li>
						Making mistakes is unacceptable and I should be upset with myself
					</li>
					<li>The best way to perform perfectly is to avoid making mistakes</li>
					<li>
						I want my performers to look good, feel correct, and get the results
						I desire
					</li>
					<li>
						My achievement in tennis is more important than the person I am
					</li>
					<li>
						Others will think I am an unworthy person unless I can prove
						unsuccessful in tennis
					</li>
					<li>I should not try to do something unless I can do it perfectly</li>
					<li><input type="text" name="" id="" /></li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Effect on performance</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Easly become frustrated and lose my confidence when not reaching my
						expectations
					</li>
					<li>This can cause me to have a trade will burnout/li></li>
					<li>
						I set myself up for failure before the competition begins and this
						can have a negative effect on my self-confidence
					</li>
					<li>
						Causes me to become over analytical in competition and worry about
						techniques
					</li>
					<li>
						causes me to overcontrol the competition and lack trust. Perform
						tight or scared
					</li>
					<li>
						Causes me to try harder to perform perfectly, and become frustrated
					</li>
					<li>
						Meet me to sit more about not making mistakes, and I cannot let go
						of mistakes.
					</li>
					<li>
						causes me to be more perfectly everything and then lose confidence
						if it is not
					</li>
					<li>
						Ego involvement. My self-worth is influenced by Sports success or
						failure
					</li>
					<li>
						Causes me to judge my own self worth based on what I assume others
						think
					</li>
					<li>
						causes me to give up or not try altogether if performing poorly(E.
						G. Tanking the match in tennis)
					</li>
					<li><input type="text" name="" id="" /></li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					these BADs(what I call core beliefs or attitudes) Garden your
					non-functional perfectionistic thinking competition and help to keep
					you stuck. For example,
				</p>
				<p>
					Based on table 5 Above, what are the top non-functional beliefs that
					support your specific perfectionistic traits in competition Cinema be
					honest with this exercise!In other words, which core beliefs are true
					about your mental game and cause you to self-destruct in competition?
					List of those beliefs here:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><input type="text" name="" id="" /></li>

					<li><input type="text" name="" id="" /></li>
					<li><input type="text" name="" id="" /></li>
					<li><input type="text" name="" id="" /></li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Using table 6 below and your response to the above exercise, your task
					is to adopt new, functional beliefs or attitudes about your sport. be
					low up examples of how to change your beliefs so you can start the
					process on your own.
