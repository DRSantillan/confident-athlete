			<h3>Day 6 - Fearless Strategy</h3>
			<p>
				The first step in today's lesson is the define your personal hot
				buttons. when are you most likely to become negative, beat yourself up,
				and engaging negative self-taught?Your personal hot buttons will be
				different from another athlete. I can help you improve yourself for
				giving you examples based on most common situations I encounter in my
				work with Athletes.
			</p>

			<h5>Below a typical situations where negative self talk can occur:</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Getting off to a slow start in game performance</li>
				<li>after making wanted to mistakes in a row</li>
				<li>Not performing up to your own expectations</li>
				<li>thinking... Here I go again... Performing poorly</li>
				<li>losing a point of getting beat when you should've won</li>
				<li>Needing to come through the crunch time to win a game</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				be low in table 8, your task is to list your top five hot buttons in
				your support and your typical reaction to each one.For example, many of
				my golf students can't stand three party. This can lead to negative self
				talk and self-criticism. golfer by calling self names after three
				cutting such as, you're A loser you are the worst part in the world!This
				can lead to frustration, trying harder, or the avoidance mindset later
				in the game – Don't three but again stupid
			</p>

				Step two is the developmental strategy for each scenario in which you
				beat yourself up or engaging negative self talk. here is the catch... I
				want you to pretend you are the most positive coach you know. What would
				you say to yourself? Using the golf example about:

				<li>
					Old reaction – I tell myself I am the worst player in the world

				<li>New Reaction</li>
