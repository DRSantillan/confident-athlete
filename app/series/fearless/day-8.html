				<h3>Day 8 - Warm-up</h3>
				<p>
					It is very common for perfectionistic athletes to worry too much about
					what others think of them. They seek social approval from others. They
					want to be admired, accepted, respected or liked by others. To some
					degree, this is normal because we are social beings who want to be
					liked by others.
				</p>
				<p>
					Athletes who crave approval from others often become anxious or are
					afraid to fail in competition. They worry about public embarrassment.
					Perfectionists rely too much on what they think others think about
					them to boost their own feelings of self-worth. They associate
					self-worth with achievement in sports.
				</p>
				<p>
					Perfectionistic athletes think they may lose approval from others by
					playing poorly or making mistakes. This worry supports an athlete’s
					fear of failure. Athletes are afraid to fail because they believe that
					there is potential for embarrassment, loss of respect, or not being
					liked by others!
				</p>
				<p>
					Worrying too much about what others may think encourages a process I
					call “mind reading.” Mind reading is when you make assumptions about
					what others might be thinking about you. When you are trying to read
					others’ minds, you try to avoid embarrassment.

					The goal of today’s lesson is to free you of the need for social
					approval, and thus free yourself from the fear. I want you to stop
					mind reading and making unfounded assumptions about what others might
					think. You most likely want the approval of other people so you can
					feel good about yourself as a person. You might use sports as an
					avenue to boost your feeling of self-worth and it sometimes backfires
					(when you don’t think you are getting it) due to failure or not being
					perfect in this case.
				</p>
				<p>
					We start by defining your self-concept outside of sports. To help you
					with this, you should use the “Defining Your Self Concept” Worksheet I
					provide in Appendix 1. In this exercise, you want to:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Select the top 12 traits that describe your personal characteristics
						- beyond yourself as an athlete or without regard to your level of
						success. In other words, who is the person when not playing sports?
					</li>
					<li>
						Ask two or three other people to complete this assignment
						individually based on what they know about you.
					</li>
					<li>
						Use the results to help you develop a strong sense of self-concept
						that is based on your personal characteristics (not on your
						achievements).
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<strong>Self-Esteem Should Not Be Based on Performance.</strong> Your
					self-esteem should not change based on what you assume others think
					about you or your success:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Use the results of “defining your self-concept” exercise completed
						in task 1 to help you.
					</li>
					<li>
						The next step is to assess your self-concept. Do you like what you
						see with the results of this self-test? In other words, do you like
						who you are? This step is called an assessment of self-concept, and
						it’s related to self-esteem.
					</li>
					<li>
						Your goal is to remember who you are no matter how you perform –
						refer back to the 12 personal characteristics you identified in step
						1.
					</li>
					<li>
						Finally, be clear that no matter how well or poorly you perform,
						people in your life do not change their opinions of who you are as a
						person! The people who matter most to you (e.g. true friends,
						family) will support you and their opinion of you is not based upon
						your achievements (or lack thereof) in sports.
					</li>
					<li>
						You must have personal self-acceptance. Meaning you should accept
						yourself no matter how well or poorly you perform in sports. Then it
						will not matter what others think about how successful you are in
						sports.
					</li>
				</ul>
