				<h3>Day 8 - Warm-up</h3>
				<p>
					is very common for perfectionistic athletes to worry too much about
					what others think of them.Basic social approval from others. they want
					to be admired, accepted, respected like my others.To some degree, this
					is normal because we are social being want to be liked by others.
					whatever, when perfectionists become too concerned about what others
					think, they perform tense, try harder to be perfect, and think more
					about avoiding mistakes with the aid of not disappointing others.
				</p>
				<p>
					Athlete to crave approval from others often become anxious or afraid
					to fail in competition. they worry about public embarrassing.
					Perfectionist rely too much on what they think others think about them
					to boost their own feelings of self-worth. They associate self worth
					with achievement in sports. They believe in friends, coaches and
					family members respect all at my athletic abilities, they somehow
					better people.This isn't just an unhealthy belief, it is an attitude
					that hinders performance.
				</p>
				<p>
					perfectionistic athletes think they may lose approval from others by
					playing quietly for making mistakes. This worry supports the athletes
					fear of failure.Athlete are afraid to fail because they believe that
					there is potential for embarrassment, loss of respect, for not being
					liked by others!
				</p>
				<p>
					Warren too much about what others think maybe think encourages a
					process I call mind reading. I'm reading is when you make assumptions
					about what others might be thinking about youwhen you were trying to
					read others minds, you try to avoid embarrassment. for example, you
					might think, if I played poorly today in front of my sponsors they
					might drop me and I'll have no funding for the rest of the season.Your
					performance suffers because you don't allow yourself to perform freely
					without the fear of disappointing others. Mind reading is it used
					distraction which ultimately leads to disappointing performance.

					the goal of today's lesson is the free year of the new social
					approval, and fast free yourself from the fear stop I want you to
					start mind reading and making unfounded assumptions about what others
					might think.You're most likely want the approval of other people so
					You can feel good about yourself as a person. you might use sports as
					an Avenue to boost your feeling of self-worth and it sometimes
					backfires(When you don't think you are getting you eyes brackets due
					to failure or not being perfect in this case.
				</p>
				<p>
					We start by defining yourself concept outside of sports. To help you
					with this, you should use the defining your self-concept worksheet I
					provide the appendix 1. In this exercise you want to:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Select top 12 traits that describe your personal characteristics –
						Beyond yourself as an athlete or without regard to your level of
						success. The other words, who is the person when not playing sports
					</li>
					<li>
						Asked two or three other people to complete this assessment
						individually based on what they know about you.
					</li>
					<li>
						Use the results to help you develop a strong sense of self concept
						that is based upon your personal characteristics(Not on your
						achievements)
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Self-esteem should not be based on your performance.Your self-esteem
					should not change based on what you assume is think about you or your
					success:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Use the results of defining yourself concept exercise completed in
						plus one to help you
					</li>
					<li>
						The next state is to assess yourself concept. do you like what you
						see with the results of this self test?In other words, do you like
						who you are?This thing is called an assessment of self-concept, and
						is and its related to self-esteem.
					</li>
					<li>
						Your goal is to remember who you are no matter how you Perform -
						Refer back to the 12 personal characteristics you identified in step
						one
					</li>
					<li>
						finally,Big clear that no matter how well or poorly you perform,
						people in your life do not change their opinions of who you are as a
						person! the people who matter most to you(True friends, family) will
						support you and their opinion of view is not based upon your
						achievements or thereof in tennis.
					</li>
					<li>
						You must have personal self-acceptance. Meaning you should accept
						yourself no matter how well or poorly you perform in tennis.Then he
						will not matter what others think about how successful you are In
						tennis.
					</li>
