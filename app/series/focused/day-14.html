				<h3>Day - Warm-up</h3>
				<p>
					Today is the day we put all your new focusing skills into action or
					practice – and I am not talking about competitive action. I am talking
					about using mental imagery to rehearse your focusing skills with the
					Focused Athlete Mental Imagery Program. How is this mental rehearsal
					program different than the “Affirm Your Focus” section? This is a
					longer mental imagery program that helps you ingrain and practice all
					The Focused Athlete concentration skills in a relaxed setting. Day 14
					also serves as an excellent summary of the skills you have learned in
					the previous 13 days.
				</p>

				<h3>Day - Daily Objective</h3>

					To review and mentally practice “The Focused Athlete” concentration
					skills, using mental rehearsal.

				<h3>Day - Daily Focus Boost</h3>
				<p>
					You will need 15-20 minutes to complete The Focused Athlete Mental
					Imagery program. I suggest that you find a quiet spot at home or in a
					hotel room where you will not be disturbed for about 20 minutes. Do
					not listen to this guided imagery program while driving a car, as it
					is important that you are completely focused on the imagery program,
					plus it’s also important for you to drive safely! The program begins
					with about 5 minutes of relaxation that is followed by the guided
					imagery program, which will take you through a general pre-game
					routine and then part of your actual performance. You will have a
					chance to practice your refocusing skills and review your pregame
					routine.
				</p>
				<p>
					This program is not specific to any sport so it applies to any
					competitive situation.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are three sections in the “Focused Athlete” Mental Imagery
					Program:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Get “present focused”</li>
					<li>Short relaxation</li>
					<li>Guided imagery program</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Please go to track 15 (Audio CD 2) now to begin The Focused Athlete
					Mental Imagery Program. You will need about 18 minutes to complete the
					Mental Imagery Program.
				</p>

			<section id="action" class="focused" ass="focused">
				<h3>Day - Taking Focused Action</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Complete the Focused Athlete Mental Imagery Program at least once
						per week and prior to important competition. Please use this program
						up to two hours prior to competition, but not right before
						competition as some athletes become too relaxed with the relaxation
						section.
