					Congratulations! You have completed The Focused Athlete. The new,
					focused you, is now on your way to superior concentration. You should
					be proud of yourself for taking action with your mental game to be the
					most focused athlete you can be, committed to excellence in sports.
					Take a moment to congratulate the efforts you have made so far!
				</p>
				<p>
					I need you to take real action now; MASSIVE action right now. You are
					armed with the information and tools to help you be a focused athlete
					and improve your mental game, which is an excellent first step! But,
					this is just the beginning to rocket your concentration to new
					heights.
				</p>
				<p>
					I inform all my mental coaching students that learning any skills,
					especially mental skills, is a three part process. The first part is
					the ability to understand the mental strategies that will help improve
					your mental game. The second stage is the ability to apply your mental
					strategies to your sport daily. The third and final stage is your
					ability to commit, over the long term – months and months, to improve
					your focus and mental attitude. Your learning is never complete
					without the diligence to stay committed to your mental training
					program.
				</p>
				<p>
					My suggestion is to review The Focused Athlete at least once a month
					and more often if necessary. Use “The Focused Athlete Evaluation”
					after every performance to help you identify areas to improve and
					bring attention to. On the following page, I have included a summary
					of the action plans for each day of the 14-day program that will help
					you take action daily. Remove this page from your workbook and post it
					where you can see it every day. You should review these action plans
					often and work daily to apply 1-2 of the concepts to your practice,
					training, and competition! On the following page, you will find the
					final Taking Focused Action Commitment Contract that you should review
					and sign now. Warning: if you sign the contract, be prepared to take
					massive action!
