				<h3>Day - Warm-up</h3>
				<p>
					A pre-shot routine is an excellent way to integrate your focusing
					skills into your regular practice and competition. For the purpose of
					this workbook, there are two goals of the pre-shot routine. The first
					is to improve the consistency of your mental preparation in the hopes
					of leading to a more consistent performance. The second purpose is to
					help you focus on performance cues and thus your execution. Preshot
					routines are best applied to self-paced tasks (stop-and-go sports,
					such as bowling) instead of continuous-play sports (such as swimming).
					However, in continuous sports, athletes can also apply routines to
					prepare for the start of a performance, also called pre-performance
					routines, such as a swimmer on the blocks before the start of a race
					or a hockey player starting a new shift.
				</p>
				<p>
					What is most important is having a good mental approach or an
					effective mental routine. The mental routine directly ties into your
					performance cues that you must focus on for successful execution. In
					fact, your performance cues actually comprise the elements of your
					routine.
				</p>
				<h4>A mental pre-shot routine works to help you to:</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Observe and process information.</li>
					<li>Make decisions, set strategies, and develop a plan.</li>
					<li>Program your mind and body to perform well.</li>
					<li>Mentally rehearse the skill you are about to execute.</li>
					<li>Get your mind in an optimal state to execute your best.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					If you neglect one of these areas in your preparation, you fail to
					prepare fully for successful execution. The objective is to train
					yourself to approach each shot or start of your performance with good
					planning, confidence, and focus on performance cues.

				<h3>Day - Daily Focus Boost</h3>
				<p>
					Your task is to develop a pre-shot or pre-performance routine that
					defines the appropriate performance cues for execution. There are 6
					steps in the mental routine you want to follow in order to prepare for
					a shot, kick, swim, or field goal for example. Below is a golf
					specific example:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<strong>Planning:</strong> Select a visual target and the type of
						shot you want to hit. Be specific and commit to the plan.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Image:</strong> See or feel the type of shot you selected in
						the plan. Make it seem as real as possible by feeling the shot or by
						visualizing the shot trajectory. (e.g., hit the green and roll into
						the hole).
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Rehearse:</strong> Use a practice swing to feel the shot you
						want to hit. Focus on balance or the simple feeling of the swing.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Focus:</strong> Stay focused on execution and the visual or
						feel of the shot.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Set up:</strong> Aim the clubface and set your body parallel
						to the left of the clubface.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Trust:</strong> Focus on the target and let the image of the
						target or the feeling of a good swing trigger the swing. No more
						than one swing should be thought about here.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Depending on your sport or the task you are performing, these steps
					will change. For example, for a tennis serve, the steps in the set up
					will differ from the golf example above. In addition, the images you
					use to see or feel successful execution will be specific to your
					learning preferences.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now it’s your turn. Using the table below, include the performance
					cues you must focus on for successful execution.

					Keep in mind that within each sport, you will have different tasks you
					perform (i.e. hitting, pitching, fielding, etc.) and you should modify

					You will be guided through a short period of relaxation (an abdominal
					breathing exercise) followed by a simple guided mental imagery
					exercise. In addition, you will repeat the following affirmations to
					yourself three times during the guided imagery exercise.

				<h3>Day - Taking Focused Action</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Athletes use a variety of images (visual, feeling, auditory, etc.)
						to help them develop the proper mindset for optimal performance. To
						make the most of imagery, you will need to tap into the correct
						pre-shot images (based on your style of learning and performing). In
						your next practice, test the different images you can use in your
						preshot routine to help you find the ones that work best for you.
					</li>
					<li>
						Be aware of how your routine breaks down during your performance. Do
						you get lazy, distracted, indecisive, or anxious during the routine?
					</li>

				<h3>Day - Focus Scoreboard</h3>
				<p>
					You can use the focus scoreboard every day after you complete the
					daily tasks to test your understanding and application of the
					concepts. (Remember; be as honest as possible to gain the most from
					the program!) From time to time, you can also review how well you are
					accomplishing the daily tasks by referring back to this scorecard.
					Using the table below, please rate your performance (circle the number
					for each item; 10 being more positive than negative and 1 being more
					negative than positive) on the following tasks:
