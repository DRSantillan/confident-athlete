				<h3>Day - Warm-up</h3>
				<p>
					One of the best methods I know to help athletes release their thoughts
					about outcomes and focus on the present moment is to give them simple
					process goals (also called mini-goals) to focus their attention to
					important cues during competition. My philosophy is this: Working the
					process brings desired results! This means you must put aside
					outcomes, results, and consequences of your performance and focus on
					the moment-to-moment execution. Ask yourself what you need to do
					moment-by-moment or play-by-play to perform your best.
				</p>
				<p>
					One note here… I only use process goals to help you become immersed in
					the ingredients of the task. Although it’s rewarding to reach your
					goals, I don’t want you to evaluate or judge whether you’re on track
					to reach them. If you do this, you are not focusing on the process.
					The pre-game routine is an excellent time to decide on process goals
					to focus on during competition.
				</p>
				<p>
					I use two types of process goals to help athletes stay in the moment:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Performance Goals:</strong> goals based on something you can
						measure such as, number of rebounds, blocked shots, or fairways hit
						in regulation.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Mental Goals:</strong> goals based on your mental game that
						help you focus on one play, shot, or routine at a time, such as
						committing to a plan or visualizing your pitch before you start the
						wind up.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Day - Daily Focus Boost</h3>
				<p>
					Each and every performance, your task is to set one or two process
					goals – both performance and mental process goals. In some sports such
					as triathlons, you can set process goals for each stage of the event
					(run, swim & bike). Let me start by giving you some sport specific
					examples of process goals or mini-goals that you can modify for your
					own sport.

						Based upon your previous performance, think about two areas of your

						Whatever you bring attention to during your performance, you will
						improve or at least think more about.

						After each performance, review the game in your mind and assess your

					You can use the focus scoreboard every day after you complete the

					concepts. (Remember; be as honest as possible to gain the most from
					the program!) From time to time, you can also review how well you are
					accomplishing the daily tasks by referring back to this scorecard.
					Using the table below, please rate your performance (circle the number
					for each item; 10 being more positive than negative and 1 being more
					negative than positive) on the following tasks:
