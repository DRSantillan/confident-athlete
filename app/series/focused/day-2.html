				<h3>Day - Warm-up</h3>
				<p>
					Every single athlete has the ability to concentrate, but sometimes
					what they focus on gets displaced or they think about the wrong stuff
					at the wrong time. Concentration can suffer from both internal and
					external distractions and can come in many forms from subtle to not so
					subtle. You must first identify your distractions during practice and
					competition.
				</p>
				<p>
					What are internal and external distractions? The most common
					distractions are called “internal distractions.” These are
					self-induced disruptions in concentration that enter your mind in the
					form of doubt, indecision, lack of confidence, or thoughts about past
					events or future outcomes. Your own thinking, and not the environment
					or other people, triggers internal distractions.
				</p>
				<p>
					The environment or what is going on outside your mind triggers
					external distractions. Some examples include people in the stands,
					harsh weather conditions, or an opponent that is trying to psych you
					out. External distractions start outside you, but can turn into
					internal distractions if not filtered correctly.
				</p>
				<p>
					No matter what type of distraction, it will break your concentration
					and cause you to make errors. Understanding your potential
					concentration breakdowns – so you can recognize them sooner – is one
					of the important keys to superior concentration. You are not perfect
					and thus neither is your ability to stay focused 100% of the time.
					This means that you will need to adjust your concentration.

					The goal is to make a list of your typical internal and external
					distractions. Some athletes are not bothered by external distractions
					at all. From my experience, it’s the internal distractions that are
					the killers to a focused state of mind. However, an external
					distraction can trigger or become an internal distraction if you let
					it.
