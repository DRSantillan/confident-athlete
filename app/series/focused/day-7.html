				<h3>Day - Warm-up</h3>
				<p>
					My formula for superior focus - and regaining your focus when it’s
					lost - comes together in today’s lesson as we begin to put all the
					previous lessons to work with a strategy called the “3 R’s for
					Refocusing.” The Three R’s are: Recognize, Regroup and Refocus.
				</p>
				<h4>A Simple 3 Step Method for Refocusing After Distractions:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Recognize</strong> — awareness that you are not on task or
						distracted.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Regroup</strong> — ability to break the current distraction
						or thought.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Refocus</strong> — to get back on the performance cues for
						the next play or shot.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The three R’s are designed to help you regain your focus as quickly as
					possible after a distraction. The moment you notice that you are
					off-task, it is highly important to regain concentration by having the
					ability to pull your focus back to your performance cues or to get
					back in the present.
				</p>
				<p>
					This entire process should not be lengthy and take no more than 2-4
					seconds to complete quickly “on the fly.” With some self-paced tasks
					such as a golf shot, tennis serve, or free throw in basketball, I
					recommend to students that they stop and restart their routine over if
					they get distracted at the wrong time.
				</p>
				<p>
					This may not be possible in some sports with continuous action, like
					hockey or basketball in which you are reacting to an opponent. That’s
					why you should quickly try and refocus on the fly. You have to learn
					to quickly recognize distractions and equally as fast, get your head
					back into the task.
				</p>

				<blockquote>
					“I have always just had good focus. I think the ability to focus
					definitely separates players – the players that are able to focus on
					the task at hand and ignore everything else that goes on will do
					better than those who get distracted in big moments during the game.”

					refocus effectively and quickly during competition.

				<h3>Day - Daily Focus Boost</h3>
				<p>
					The first R in the Three R’s deals with awareness, which I discussed
					in lesson 6. The second R (Regroup) is the transition between
					awareness (“I am not focused”) to action (“I need to get my head in
					the game”). The third R is the most important step, because this is
					how you will immerse yourself into your performance after a short
					brain fade.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am not talking about brain surgery here – Recognize – Regroup – and
					Refocus. What are some ways you can regroup so you can begin to
					refocus?
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>“STOP! – that thought is not relevant.”</li>
					<li>“GET BACK – this is not important.”</li>
					<li>“Get your head in the game!”</li>
					<li>“Stop dwelling in the past!”</li>
					<li>“Forget about the future!”</li>
					<li>“I control my own thoughts and focus.”</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					I think you get the idea above. You want to use a short statement to
					zap you into the present moment as a way of getting you ready to
					re-engage with your performance cues. Here is a good question you can
					ask yourself to help you with the final and most important R
					(Refocus): “What do I need to focus on right now to execute this play,
					shot, or routine?” You might also use a physical cue to mentally
					trigger yourself to refocus. Many athletes use physical triggers to
					start an at-bat routine for example, or to get refocused as well, such
					as tapping the bat on the plate at the start of an at-bat. Another
					example is when a golfer tightens her golf glove, which is symbolic to
					tightening her focus for the shot.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is time for your daily exercise. Using the Triggers from Table 10
					in the last session, I want you to develop a specific strategy to help
					you refocus on the task, by applying the three R’s. The purpose of
					this is to be prepared for any distraction and to have a strategy in
					place that you pre-planned. I have given one example in the table
					below to help you get started.
