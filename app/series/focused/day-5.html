				<h3>Day - Warm-up</h3>
				<p>
					Up to this point in the program, we have only talked about identifying
					the information that is relevant to successful performance. However,
					the information that is not relevant is an important step in helping
					you improve focus too. Many of the athletes I work with tend to
					overload their brains with too much information – more than they can
					handle at one time.
				</p>
				<p>
					Information overload or having misleading information sends mixed
					signals to your body. In this indecisive state, the body will not
					execute with the desired outcome or rhythm. Once you define
					performance cues and can clearly recognize non-relevant cues or
					distractions, you are now in a better position to become fully
					immersed into your performance – an important quality of being in the
					zone or gaining a zone focus.

				<h3>Day - Daily Focus Boost</h3>
				<p>
					The goal of becoming fully immersed into your sport or performing a
					skill is to keep your mind fixed on what is important- as I have
					discussed. One way we can accomplish immersion in the task is to have
					you perform a short, guided, mental rehearsal task.
				</p>
				<h4>Here is your task:</h4>
				<p>
					Find a quiet area where you will not be distracted. Close your eyes
					and experience yourself at your favorite place such as a beach,
					meadow, stream, forest, mountain or ocean. This place should be
					special to you, as well as peaceful and joyous. Now, I want you to
					take in the environment, noticing everything you can about your
					surroundings, such as sights, feelings, sounds, smells, and tastes, or
					any other information that comes to mind. Just observe your
					environment and what you are feeling right now. In your mind, become
					fully immersed into this experience of observing your favorite place.
				</p>
				<p>
					Your mission is to stay immersed into absorbing and noticing your
					surroundings without getting distracted by irrelevant thoughts. If a
					distraction does enter your mind, let it pass and get back to
					experiencing your favorite place and noticing your surrounding.
				</p>
				<p>
					If this task was easy for you to do without any internal distractions,
					then you have the ability to become immersed into your sports tasks.
					Practice this skill often if you had trouble focusing on your favorite
					place without distractions. You will find that the more you practice,
					the easier it will get to become fully immersed in your sports tasks.

				<h3>Day - Affirm Your Focus</h3>
				<p>
					You will be guided through a short period of relaxation (an abdominal
					breathing exercise) followed by a simple guided mental imagery
					exercise. In addition, you will repeat the following affirmations to
					yourself three times during the guided imagery exercise.

				<h3>Day - Taking Focused Action</h3>

						Throughout the course of your daily activities, I want you to notice

				<h3>Day - Focus Scoreboard</h3>
				<p>
					You can use the focus scoreboard every day after you complete the
					daily tasks to test your understanding and application of the
					concepts. (Remember; be as honest as possible to gain the most from
					the program!) From time to time, you can also review how well you are
					accomplishing the daily tasks by referring back to this scorecard.
					Using the table below, please rate your performance (circle the number
					for each item; 10 being more positive than negative and 1 being more
					negative than positive) on the following tasks:
