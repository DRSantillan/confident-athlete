				<h3>Day - Warm-up</h3>
				<p>
					The difficultly in writing a workbook that pertains to all sports is
					that I have to write broadly enough to cover many sports and sports
					skills. The purpose of Day 8 is to give you specific strategies for
					refocusing and concentrating your best, related to self-paced and
					continuous type sports. I cannot cover all sports here, but I can give
					you some advice on how to refocus for skills that are similar to the
					ones you perform.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some sports are very fast paced (hockey, soccer, auto racing,
					racquetball) and require you to refocus quickly or you might lose the
					game, match, or race, or at least, compound an error. Other sports
					such as bowling, golf, and baseball, are not fast paced and give you
					time to refocus because of a natural stop-and-go action that happens
					between shots or pitches. These sports are called self-paced tasks
					because the action is paced by the performer, not by another player or
					response to a specific action (e.g. starting gun, whistle, tip off,
					etc).
				</p>
				<p>
					In fast paced sports that do not have natural breaks in the play, but
					instead have a continual action, the task of refocusing is both more
					critical and harder to do at the same time. However, in self-paced
					sports, you have a lot of time to process your next or last shot and
					use The Three R’s prior to execution.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition, most self-paced sports skills allow you the opportunity
					to stop your preshot, pre-pitch, or pre-service routine and start over
					or restart the routine from an earlier point in the routine. You want
					to make sure you are completely ready to hit a shot, serve or throw
					the pitch before you execute.

				<h3>Day - Concentration Clip</h3>
				<blockquote>
					“What works well for gymnasts, especially on the beam, is mental cues.
					Instead of being distracted by her surroundings, a gymnast is thinking
					about performance cues such as, ‘stay tight or point your toes on the
					beam.’ They use the same mental choreography every time they compete
					and it never changes.”

				<h3>Day - Daily Objective</h3>
				<p>
					To learn specific strategies for refocusing that are related to the
					skills you perform in your sport
				</p>

				<h3>Day - Daily Focus Boost</h3>
				<p>
					Let’s start with self-paced sports tasks that are performed in golf,
					tennis, bowling, free-throws, penalty kicks, and any other tasks you
					control when the action starts. If you play these sports or another
					self-paced task, you have the luxury to not begin the serve or shot
					until you are completely focused and ready (within the rules of the
					game of course). If you can learn how to use the extra time to refine
					your focus you’ll find it an asset. However, if you spend your time
					unwisely by investing it into over-analyzing or over-thinking the
					performance, you won’t perform your best.”
				</p>
				<p>
					With sports that have non-stop action or are continuous (none or very
					little breaks in action) such as auto racing, hockey, swimming,
					running, or soccer, you can lose precious seconds with just one
					distraction. One simple mental slip caused by a distraction in a race
					car can cause you to wreck the car or lose valuable seconds from lap
					times. Continuous-action sports require that you are completely
					focused during competition. And if you do become distracted, you must
					learn to refocus very quickly – your life may literally depend on it!
				</p>
				<h4>
					With self-paced sports or tasks, you have two options for refocusing:
				</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Restart your routine</li>
					<li>Refocus quickly “on the fly”</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>
					With continuous-action sports, in most cases, you only have one option
					for refocusing:
				</h4>
				<p>Refocus quickly “on the fly”, or in real-time</p>
				<p>
					Let’s see how both refocusing strategies work using specific examples.
					You will need to make the application to your sport based on the
					examples below:
				</p>
				<h4>Refocus Routine for Self-Paced task (Basketball Free Throw)</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<strong>Recognize – </strong>You sight someone behind the basket
						trying to distract you on purpose while you are about to hit the
						shot.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Regroup – </strong>say to yourself “Stop – wrong thing to
						focus on.” You decide to restart your preshot routine from the ball
						bounce.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Refocus – </strong>You re-engage with your preshot routine
						from the ball bounce and stay focused on the target only.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>Refocus Routine for Continuous Sports (Triathlon)</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<strong>Recognize – </strong>In the mass start, your swim goggles
						get knocked off or hit so they are flooded with water inside.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Regroup – </strong>Focus on moving to the outside, where you
						can put them back on or get the water out of your eyes.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Refocus – </strong>Focus on getting back into a rhythm with
						your swim stroke. It’s a long race, you can get the time back on the
						bike or run.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			<section class="affirm">
				<h3>Day - Affirm Your Focus</h3>
				<p>
					You will be guided through a short period of relaxation (an abdominal
					breathing exercise) followed by a simple guided mental imagery
					exercise. In addition, you will repeat the following affirmations to
					yourself three times during the guided imagery exercise.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<mark
							>“No matter what happens, I can refocus quickly and
							effortlessly.”</mark
						>
					</li>
					<li>
						<mark
							>“I have the discipline to stop my routine and restart my mental
							engine.”</mark
						>
					</li>
					<li>
						<mark
							>“I deserve to take my time by restarting my routine to help me
							refocus.”</mark
						>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			<section class="action">
				<h3>Day - Taking Focused Action</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Practice your refocus on the fly for continuous action sports, both
						in practice and in competition.
					</li>
					<li>
						For self-paced sports, force yourself to restart your mental routine
						when you become distracted at least 6 times during a game or round.
					</li>
				</ul>

			<section class="scoreboad">
				<h3>Day - Focus Scoreboard</h3>
				<p>
					You can use the focus scoreboard every day after you complete the
					daily tasks to test your understanding and application of the
					concepts. (Remember; be as honest as possible to gain the most from
					the program!) From time to time, you can also review how well you are
					accomplishing the daily tasks by referring back to this scorecard.
					Using the table below, please rate your performance (circle the number
					for each item; 10 being more positive than negative and 1 being more
					negative than positive) on the following tasks:
