					A 14-Day Plan for Superior Concentration
				</h3>

				<p>
					Welcome to The Focused Athlete: A 14-day Plan for Superior
					Concentration. Next to self-confidence, the ability to focus is
					critical for peak performance in sports. World championship athletes
					know how to harness the power of a zone focus and I want to teach you
					how to do the same. I am contacted regularly by many athletes who
					either want to improve their confidence or have trouble focusing on
					the playing fields. Since focus is so important to your success and
					reaching peak performance, I have decided that the second workbook in
					our “Confident Athlete Series” needs to be “The Focused Athlete”.
				</p>
				<p>
					The focused athlete teaches everything I share when working with my
					individual mental coaching students. At the end of this program, you
					will have learned the key concentration skills so you can achieve a
					zone focus for peak performance in your sport. In “The Focused
					Athlete” I provide you with a system to understand: what to focus on,
					how to focus on what is important, and how to deal with common
					distractions that all athletes must learn to overcome in order to be
					successful.
				</p>
				<p></p>

				</blockquote>

				<p>
					Superior concentration occurs when you become totally immersed in a
					task, feel that time is suspended, and lose the sense of being
					separated from your sports environment, (such as when a baseball
					player reports he can see the seams of a baseball traveling at over 90
					MPH). Your goal every time you hit the field, court, or course is to
					have a razor-sharp focus, a mind clear of daily hassles, and the
					ability to focus on what is important in your environment.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most athletes and coaches don’t realize that the most important step
					in developing superior concentration is the ability to REFOCUS when
					you get distracted or offtask. You are human – just like the best
					athletes in the world – and your focus will drift or become confused
					at times. When this happens, it doesn’t mean that you lack the skills
					to be a great athlete, rather that you need to learn how to refocus to
					excel. As I teach all of my students, I remind them that the first
					step to learning to overcome an issue is to recognize when it starts.
					To refocus, you must be able to recognize when your mind has drifted
					from the task, make an adjustment, and get on with focusing on the
					task-relevant information.
				</p>
				<p>
					Over the last 15 or so years of working with athletes from all sports
					and all levels, I have learned that you must work at improving
					concentration just as an athlete works at developing a perfect jump
					shot in basketball. You must also understand how to enhance
					concentration by coping with the mental gremlins that disrupt
					concentration. The Focused Athlete teaches you both how to harness
					superior concentration to get you into a zone focus for peak
					performance AND how to fend off distractions and other non-important
					information that disrupts a zone focus.

				<h3>How to use this program</h3>

				<p>
					Each day you will be given specific tasks to complete to work on your
					concentration. At the end of 14 days, you should be on your way to
					superior concentration. Every day of the program is divided into daily
					tasks for you to complete. To get the best focus from each daily focus
					boost, you should complete all the tasks in each day.
				</p>

				<p>
					Use the audio program that came with The Focused Athlete to help guide
					you through your concentration program. Listen to the audio for Day 1
					and then complete the workbook exercises before proceeding to Day 2
					audio.
				</p>
				<p>
					Table 1, below, is a description of the daily tasks you will complete
					in each section to enhance your focus.
