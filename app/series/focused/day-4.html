					The next step is to define the thoughts, feelings, and environmental
					cues that are not important (also called task-irrelevant cues that
					have no relevance to your performance). You need to be able to
					distinguish between what is important to focus on for execution and
					what is just a distraction to your performance. The list of
					non-relevant information is much longer than what is relevant to your
					performance.
				</p>
				<p>
					Irrelevant information in the form of internal or external
					distractions can cloud your focus and prevent you from focusing on the
					task at hand. If irrelevant cues or distractions go unchecked in your
					mind, your concentration and performance will suffer. Before you
					realize it, a small distraction can cause you to miss an important
					free throw or miss an easy putt, for example, if you are trying to hit
					a putt and you have a thought related to what you need to do after the
					round pops into your head.
				</p>
				<p>
					What are task-irrelevant cues or thoughts? As an athlete, your mind is
					bombarded with a multitude of thoughts, feelings, emotions, and
					external information in which you have to filter and attend to the
					important stuff. For example, thinking about what you will do after
					the hockey game has no bearing on the current play you are running in
					the game. Thus, it’s not important, nor relevant to helping you
					execute a play.

				<h3>Day - Concentration Clip</h3>

				<h3>Day - Daily Focus Boost</h3>
				<p>
					Once again I want you to do another awareness exercise that requires
					you to think about your past performances or practices. The idea is to
					identify and define the thoughts, feelings, images, and outside
					distractions or irrelevant information that enters your mind during
					practice or competition.
				</p>
				<p>
					Using the same skills you defined yesterday in day 3, your task is to
					write out typical task-irrelevant cues that break your focus. In this
					exercise, I expect there to be an over lap between task irrelevant
					cues for each skill you perform because of your personal tendencies to
					becoming distracted – everyone is a little different here. I will use
					a baseball example to highlight task-irrelevant cues in Table 7 below.

					I think you get the idea that there are many thoughts or distractions
					that can run through your mind that do not have anything to do with a
					successful pitch or atbat. Most likely, your mind wanders differently
					from a teammate or any other person – so distractions are unique to
					your situation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once again, it’s your turn. Using your sport, divide your sport into
					three or four skills or sub skills. For example in tennis, you would
					have: service, baseline rally, net volley, and overhead. List the top
					irrelevant cues for each task below…
