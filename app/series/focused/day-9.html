				<h3>Day - Warm-up</h3>
				<p>
					How often do you go into a game unable to forget about an argument you
					had with a best friend or preoccupied with the exam you will be taking
					the next day? For some athletes, they bring life’s challenges and
					hassles with them when they enter the sports arena. One goal of this
					program is to help you enter the role of the focused athlete.
				</p>
				<p>
					I teach my students to suspend their life outside of sports so they
					can focus completely on their performance – if only for 2 hours at a
					time. When you step onto the arena or practice facility, you must
					assume the role of athlete, the focused athlete. However, this does
					not mean you are ignoring real-life issues and challenges you are
					faced with at the time. Entering your role as athlete only means that
					you switch mental gears and now give yourself permission to focus on
					your sport without the mental handcuffs that you may otherwise bring
					into competition.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can enter the role of the athlete by leaving life’s distractions
					in the parking lot and allowing yourself to be selfish for a couple
					hours. For example, to turn “off” life distractions and concentrate on
					your sport, write a task list of what you have to do after
					competition, (such as a school paper) then make a commitment to
					yourself to leave the list in the parking lot, your locker, or hotel
					room. After competition you can go back to your task list and do not
					need to worry about it during play.

				<h3>Day - Daily Focus Boost</h3>
				<p>
					Although many athletes know how to suspend their daily hassles in
					life, I would like to discuss my plan for doing this. The first place
					to start is to understand what “distractions” from life you may bring
					into competition. Let us begin with some common examples:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Worrying about upcoming school projects which need to be completed
						or tests you need to pass.
					</li>
					<li>
						Worrying about friendships because you spend so much time on your
						sport.
					</li>
					<li>
						Thinking about the amount of work you have to do after your game or
						performance.
					</li>
					<li>
						Having an unresolved issue in your life that causes emotional pain
						such as a divorce.
					</li>
					<li>Being preoccupied with finance issues in your life.</li>
					<li>Worrying about a sick child or another family member at home.</li>
					<li>Dwelling about sponsors not signing you for a new season.</li>
					<li>
						Failing to let go of an argument you had with your boss or
						co-worker.
					</li>
				</ul>

						<div class="container__col">

									“I can be selfish for 3 hours during the game. Think about
									what I need to do to help my team.”
								</li>
								<li>
									“After the game, I will have more time to think about
									decisions I need to make in my life.”
								</li>
								<li>
									“This is my time to have fun and let go of personal
									decisions.”
								</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="container__row">
						<div class="container__col">
							3. Commit yourself to focusing only on your sport and having fun.
							Remind yourself that only the present moment matters and to
							concentrate fully on execution.
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="container__row">
						<div class="container__col">
							4. Likewise you should also leave your sports performance on the
							field, court, or course so you can enjoy other areas of your life.

				<h3>Day - Affirm Your Focus</h3>
				<p>
					You will be guided through a short period of relaxation (an abdominal
					breathing exercise) followed by a simple guided mental imagery
					exercise. In addition, you will repeat the following affirmations to
					yourself three times during the guided imagery exercise.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<mark
							>“I will not let any matters in my life affect my sports

				<h3>Day - Taking Focused Action</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						20 minutes before you start practice or a game, notice if you are
						thinking about concerns from your life. Write these in your
						workbook.
					</li>
					<li>
						Review or write down what you should focus on during the game to
						have a good performance. This can include strategy, game plan,
						process goals, and performance cues.
					</li>
					<li>
						If you find yourself preoccupied with a problem outside of your
						sport, use your Three R’s to refocus.
					</li>
					<li>
						You should also leave your performance on the field, court, or
						course when you go home or back to your hotel room.

				<h3>Day - Focus Scoreboard</h3>
				<p>
					You can use the focus scoreboard every day after you complete the
					daily tasks to test your understanding and application of the
					concepts. (Remember; be as honest as possible to gain the most from
					the program!) From time to time, you can also review how well you are
					accomplishing the daily tasks by referring back to this scorecard.
					Using the table below, please rate your performance (circle the number
					for each item; 10 being more positive than negative and 1 being more
					negative than positive) on the following tasks:
