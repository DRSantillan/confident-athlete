				<h3>Day 1 - Warm-up</h3>
				<p>
					The pinnacle of a focused state of mind in sports is what we call
					being in “the zone.” What is the zone or a zone focus? Some athletes
					describe this state of awareness as flow, in a cocoon, or in a bubble.
					Regardless of how you describe the zone, it’s simply a state of total
					involvement in the task that you are performing in the present moment.
					We don’t need to make this complicated – it’s what you choose to
					attend to in your environment. And this changes from sport to sport
					and task to task within each sport.
				</p>
				<p>
					My definition of focus is the ability to concentrate or pay attention
					to relevant tasks in the present moment without getting pulled off
					task by internal or external distractions (Later, I will define these
					two types of distractions). One note before I go any further, I use
					the words “focus” and “concentration” interchangeably.
				</p>
				<p>
					Total concentration occurs when you become absorbed in the moment or
					task, lose track of time, and lose a sense of being separate from your
					sports experience. I know this sounds a little Zen like, but this
					ideal state is what I want you to understand, adopt and apply in your
					sport.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition, concentration is an ability to not attend to distractions
					or taskirrelevant cues that will upset your focus from the main
					objective of performing your best!
				</p>
				<p>
					Thus, in summary, concentration or focus includes the following
					elements:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Your ability to identify what’s relevant to focus on for peak
						performance in your sport
					</li>
					<li>
						Your ability to only focus on what is important to attend to for
						each task
					</li>
					<li>
						Your ability to stay focused in the present moment – or immersed
					</li>
					<li>
						Your ability to insulate yourself from distractions and an ability
						to refocus when you become distracted
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Day 1 - Concentration Clip</h3>
				<blockquote>
					“I felt as though I was driving in a tunnel. The whole circuit became
					a tunnel... I had reached such a high level of concentration that it
					was as if the car and I had become one. Together we were at the
					maximum. I was giving the car everything - and vice versa.”

					This exercise is designed to help improve your awareness of your
					experience of feelings when you are in a superior state of
					concentration. This requires that you think back to a recent
					performance when you were completely focused and in the zone. Note: If
					you feel like you have never been in the zone, then think about a
					period of time when you were totally focused, even if only for a few
					minutes.

				<h3>Day 1 - Taking Focused Action</h3>
				<p>
					Why is understanding your zone state important? Everyone experiences a
					zone state differently. It is critical to understand how you feel and
					behave at those times when you have been totally focused. This is your
					template to use in the future to reproduce or reconstruct a state of
					total focus.
				</p>
				<p>
					Based on the 5 or more qualities you listed in table 3, your task is
					to relive (mentally rehearse) what it felt like the last time you were
					in a state of total focus. Use the questions below to help you recall
					the important thoughts, feelings, and images when you were in a
					heightened state of focus during a mini mental rehearsal.
				</p>
				<h4>Questions to Consider:</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Recall the last time you were totally focused.</li>
					<li>What happened before the game or performance?</li>
					<li>What were you thinking about before it started?</li>
					<li>How would you describe your focus?</li>
					<li>What did it feel like when you re-lived this experience?</li>
					<li>
						What was different about this time from your typical experience when
						performing?
					</li>
					<li>Did you feel tired or energized during this performance?</li>
					<li>What emotions did you feel during this performance?</li>
					<li>Did time seem to slow down or go by faster than normal?</li>
					<li>How did a state of focus affect your performance?</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Can you see yourself performing with this same level of focus in your
					next game or performance? The goal is to be able to harness this level
					of focus every time you step onto the court, field, or track. One way
					to do this is to recall what it felt like in the past and rehearse
					this feeling for the next game or performance.

				<h3>Day 1 - Focus Scoreboard</h3>

					You can use the focus scoreboard every day after you complete the

					the program!) From time to time, you can also review how well you are
					accomplishing the daily tasks by referring back to this scorecard.
