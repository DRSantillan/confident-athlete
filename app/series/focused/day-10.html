				<h3>Day - Warm-up</h3>
				<p>
					Professional athletes use specific pregame rituals or routines to
					instill a winning mindset, and you should too. The ultimate goal of
					your pregame routine is to create a mindset that lets you perform up
					to your full potential! Consistent mental preparation leads to
					consistent performance - the hallmark of champion athletes. Your
					pregame warm up is an excellent time to integrate your focusing
					strategies.
				</p>
				<p>
					Think of the pregame routine as your final mental tune-up prior to
					competition. It has four important purposes: (1) to get loose and
					physically warm up, (2) to focus the mind, (3) to instill confidence,
					and (4) to help you trust your ability. The pregame routine is also an
					excellent time to transition from life into sport – and assume or
					enter the role of the focused athlete.
				</p>
				<p>
					For more information on pregame routines, please refer my e-book
					titled, “Get Psyched to Win: Pregame Mental Strategies to Perform Your
					Best.” Here is the link to my proshop:

					“I used to as a player—and I still do this as a coach—try to get
					myself into the same mindset every game… What I used to do before the
					game is I would try to visualize what I was going to do. So I would
					walk around the floor, visualize shooting the ball in different spots
					on the floor.”

				<h3>Day - Daily Focus Boost</h3>
				<p>The 4 main objectives of the pregame routine are as follows:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<strong>To be fully focused on execution.</strong> What you focus on
						prior to competition is critical to your mental game success. As we
						have discussed, you must direct your focus in a meaningful way.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>To feel confident in one’s skills.</strong> Confidence is
						the number one objective of your mental preparation. Confidence
						without strict expectations is my formula for success. As you will
						learn, confidence is built in many ways, some sources are practice,
						preparation, game plans and the mindsets you maintain (see “The
						Confident Athlete” CD Program:
						http://www.peaksports.com/proshop.php).
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>To prepare to cope with adversity.</strong> In the corporate
						world, executives are taught to develop a crisis plan before an
						emergency strikes. This allows them to formulate a plan when their
						heads are clear, rather than trying to create a plan out of
						necessity when emotions are running high. Experienced athletes
						create coping mechanisms to deal with different forms of adversity,
						such as situations that could cause them to lose focus, confidence
						or composure. The goal here is to anticipate the challenges that
						might affect your ability to focus your best and develop strategies
						to cope with each situation.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>To fully enter the role of the athlete.</strong> This was
						covered in the last session (lesson 9). I use this phase to help
						athletes make the transition between life and sports.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Below are the steps to take in the pregame mental routine that you
					will need to modify for your sport. Please complete the third column

				<h3>Day - Affirm Your Focus</h3>
				<p>
					You will be guided through a short period of relaxation (an abdominal
					breathing exercise) followed by a simple guided mental imagery
					exercise. In addition, you will repeat the following affirmations to
					yourself three times during the guided imagery exercise.

						pre-game routine.

						The second step is to begin to apply your pre-game routine to
						competition. Start with one or two of the concepts in this section
						first, and add more concepts as you get better.

					You can use the focus scoreboard every day after you complete the

					accomplishing the daily tasks by referring back to this scorecard.
