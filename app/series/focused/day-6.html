				<h3>Day - Warm-up</h3>
				<p>
					As we discussed in the last lesson, the goal is to become fully
					immersed into your performance cues so that distracting thoughts do
					not have power to penetrate your focus. If you think of your attention
					as having a limited amount of space – in terms of what you can focus
					on at one time – with only enough capacity for what you want and need
					to focus on, it does not allow room for distractions to penetrate.
					However, this is the ideal state and not always the case when you are
					in a boring practice session or playing in a big game and under
					pressure. Thus, it is critical for you to learn how to refocus when
					you do have a distraction – and the first step is awareness.
				</p>
				<p>
					Great athletes have enough awareness to know when they are in focus or
					slightly unfocused. Awareness is simply the ability to recognize when
					you are not focused, when the mind wanders, or when your mind is too
					active to concentrate. Therefore, the very first step in helping you
					get back on track after your mind strays is to catch yourself before
					you slip or make an error.

				<h3>Day - Daily Objective</h3>
				<p>
					To develop an awareness of the personal triggers that will help you
					refocus quickly and effectively when you do get distracted.

				<h3>Day - Daily Focus Boost</h3>
				<p>
					Awareness can be both good and bad in sports. If you are too aware of
					your surroundings during a game to the point that your environment
					distracts you (i.e. a fan in the stands that is yelling), then you
					will not have total focus on your performance. However, for this daily
					concentration boost, I want you to have the awareness of the triggers
					that distract you, so you can stop what you are thinking about, and be
					able to make an adjustment.
				</p>
				<p>
					The previous 2 sections should help you do this because you now know
					what you should and should not attend to when competing. This
					heightens your awareness of the wrong thoughts or cues to think about
					during practice or performance.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most athletes have specific distractions they must deal with daily. I
					call these typical distractions. In addition, these distractions are
					triggered by some external “event” that happens to you when you are
					performing. A classic example is when you feel you got a bad call from
					an official. This can turn into an internal distraction, because you
					start to dwell on it and maybe even feel frustrated that you were on
					the end of a bad call, but this is something that is out of your
					control.
				</p>
				<p>
					Your task in Table 9 below is to identify the most common external
					events that trigger distractions during a game situation. When you are
					aware of the triggers, you once again have a better chance to
					recognize that you need to make an adjustment mentally. In the table
					below you will find some examples to help you get started:
