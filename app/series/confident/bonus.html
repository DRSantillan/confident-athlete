				<h3>Bonus - Introduction</h3>
				<p>
					Athletes that begin a personal coaching program with me usually do not
					understand the difference between confidence (a positive attribute)
					and expectation (a negative attribute), at least the way I define
					them. However, by the end of the first session, my students do
					understand. Most people think if you have high expectations, you also
					must have high confidence. The question I often get is: If I expect to
					win or expect to play well, doesn’t that mean that I am confident that
					I can win or play well?
				</p>
				<p>
					My answer is a big “NO.” Even the sports psychology literature mixes
					the terms confidence and expectation, which I think is wrong. I
					however, define these terms for my students so they can understand how
					expectation and confidence are interconnected – that expectations are
					not healthy for developing supreme levels of confidence.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here is my conclusion after working with 1000’s of athletes: strict or
					high expectations can undermine and suck the life out of confidence.
				</p>
				<p>
					Let me explain my reasoning. First, some definitions are in order.
					Confidence is based on the strength of the belief in your ability or
					how strongly you think you can win. Expectation, on the other hand,
					are judgments and demands that you place on your performance usually
					pertaining to outcomes or personal statistics such as the number of
					points scored in a game.
				</p>
				<p>
					Confidence is simply a belief that precedes your performance such as
					when you see a good shot and feel like you will hit a good shot prior
					to execution. But confidence is void of strict expectations or the
					dire need to execute a good shot. In addition, a confident athlete
					does not judge the quality of the performance based on prior strict
					expectations, results or outcomes.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thus, I define confidence and expectation to have different meanings;
					expectations are dire needs or demands that you place on yourself
					about the quality of your performance – sort of judgmental demands
					because you constantly judge the quality of your performance and
					outcomes based on prior expectations. They are typically focused on
					results or a standard you have for your performance.
				</p>
				<p>
					Why are expectations so harmful to your confidence? First, you set
					yourself up for a win/lose proposition. You either achieve your
					expectations or you fail to achieve your expectations. Second, if you
					don’t achieve your predetermined expectations, it’s easy to question
					your ability that day either during or after your performance.
					Essentially, you set yourself up for failure before you even start.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most athletes who have experienced success at any level, naturally
					have very high expectations for their performance. I think
					expectations naturally develop from success. Athletes then think that
					an expectation-filled mindset for competition is the norm. After all,
					shouldn’t you expect great things from yourself? Expect the best and
					demand high levels of performance. It sounds good.
				</p>
				<p>
					Although this type of thinking sounds correct – it is not ideal
					because it sets you up for disappointment and frustration if you don’t
					execute on cue or achieve your expectations.
				</p>
				<p>
					What makes expectations even more harmful is athletes elevate their
					expectations to an extent that prices in a level of perfection. For
					example, expecting to throw a no-hitter every game, expecting to hit
					perfect shots, or expecting to not make any errors in the hockey game
					are all examples of strict expectations that are unrealistic and
					almost impossible to achieve.
				</p>
				<p>
					How many no-hitters did Nolan Ryan throw in his long, coveted career?
					Maybe a total of 6?
				</p>
				<p>
					Ben Hogan, one of the best ball-strikers in the history of golf wrote
					that he only hit 3-4 shots just as he imagined in his mind during a
					round of golf and the rest of the shots were just good misses. And how
					many hockey games have you played when you made zero errors. So the
					more unrealistic or perfectionistic your expectations, the harder they
					are to achieve – usually impossible to achieve, then the easier it is
					to fall short and judge your performance as inadequate or less than
					perfect.
				</p>
				<p>
					This type of thinking leads me to the conclusion that expectations are
					really harmful to confidence and the ideal scenario is to have high
					levels of confidence (based on past performance and training) without
					the judgmental behavior that comes with expectation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thus, one of my “Formulas for Success” that I teach to my students is
					to develop high levels of confidence void of any expectations at all.
					To do this I help athletes replace expectations by setting manageable
					goals that are not based on judgmental behavior.

				<h3>Four Case Studies on Harmful Expectations</h3>
				<p>
					To highlight the effects of high expectations on confidence and
					emotional control, I would like to share a few real-life case studies
					of students I have worked with from various sports.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<h4>NASCAR Driver Gets Frustrated</h4>
						<p>
							A couple years ago, a top 10 NASCAR driver approached me with a
							specific problem he was experiencing in the car. He said that when
							the race did not go according to his plan, he would become very
							agitated, frustrated, and lose confidence altogether.
						</p>
						<p>
							As we talked more about his thought process and past history, it
							was clear to me that his past success as a driver was actually
							working against him. Why? He had won races at every level of his
							career and his main goal was to win races and contend. But as time
							went on, his goals about winning turned into expectations about
							winning. He badly wanted to win races.
						</p>
						<p>
							Having high expectations about his performance actually made him
							unravel when he did not reach his expectations.
						</p>
						<p>
							When something went wrong with the equipment, such as a flat tire,
							this did not fit his expectations of winning or contending. And
							this is the danger of maintaining judgmental expectations. An
							athlete will likely become upset, frustrated, and even lose
							confidence when he or she can’t meet the strict demands set for
							performance.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Baseball Pitcher Loses Confidence</h4>
						<p>
							I worked with a college pitcher who maintained what I would deem
							as unrealistic expectations about his performance on the mound. As
							we talked about his goals for each game, it was clear to me that
							this ball player was placing very high expectations on his
							pitching performance.
						</p>
						<p>
							He wanted to throw a no-hitter every time he stepped on the mound.
							Throwing a no-hitter is equivalent to a perfect game in baseball –
							that is if you are the pitcher. A no-hitter is very hard to
							accomplish and rarely happens to even the best pitchers in
							baseball.
						</p>
						<p>
							So what do you think happened when his chances of a no-hitter were
							quashed when someone from the opposing team got a hit off him?
							That is right – he became upset and lost his composure for a few
							innings and by that time he would give up a few more hits!
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Golfer’s Perfectionism Leads to Low Confidence</h4>
						<p>
							Many of the golfers I work with have perfectionistic tendencies. I
							have not discovered if these tendencies are because of the
							personality of golfers or the game itself makes for perfectionism
							(most likely a combination of both), but I also see this in many
							other sports too.
						</p>
						<p>
							Anyway, one golfer I worked with had the expectation to hit
							perfect shots on the course. This is impossible in the game of
							golf. You can’t make a perfect swing every shot, hit the ball in
							the center of the club, have a perfect flight to the shot, and
							have it land next to the pit or right on the target on every shot.
						</p>
						<p>
							The game of golf is about managing misses instead of hitting
							perfect shots. So this golfer essentially started the round with
							an unrealistic expectation to hit the ball perfectly every shot.
							When he hit his first bad or even marginal shot, he would start to
							question his swing mechanics and wonder if he would hit the ball
							well enough to score a low round that day.
						</p>
						<p>
							This opened the gate for more mental errors. He would start to
							analyze the mistake and try to fix it on the course, which led to
							making more bad swings. Soon he would be so distraught with his
							inability to hit perfect golf shots that he wanted to just get off
							the course and go work on his golf swing.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Baseball Hitter’s Stats Get in the Way of At-Bat Focus</h4>
						<p>
							Do you ever go into a game thinking that you need to score at
							least 10 points in the basketball game, break 75 in the golf game,
							or create at least 3 assists each soccer game?
						</p>
						<p>
							Statistics are important in sports, don’t get me wrong, and can be
							used to improve your performance, especially to help you modify
							practice time. But the problem is that too many of my students
							have expectations about achieving their own statistical
							milestones.
						</p>
						<p>
							This particular student was way too concerned about his batting
							stats because he knew the scouts would be paying attention to his
							stats that year. He thought that getting signed with a good
							collegiate team depended on the quality of his statistics.
						</p>
						<p>
							Thus he would go into each game focusing on his hitting stats with
							specific expectations for hitting, which caused him to focus on
							the results instead of the process. As you can see, expectations
							often cause you to judge yourself in a game based on your
							preconceived demands. When he did not reach the desired hitting
							performance he felt he needed to reach, his performance got even
							worse because he would question his hitting ability and lose
							confidence.
						</p>
						<p>
							I have presented four of many examples in sports about how
							expectations focused on results, desired statistics, and
							unrealistic demands can sabotage your performance and negatively
							affect your confidence, especially when you don’t achieve your
							judgmental expectations.

				<h3>What is the Solution?</h3>
				<p>
					It might be obvious to you by now that I advocate a mindset void of
					expectations altogether. I teach my so-called “formula for success” to
					all my personal coaching students and peaksports.com members. This
					formula is a basic mental skill that all my students must master. The
					formula includes the following:
				</p>
				<h3>Dr. Cohn’s Mental Game Formula for Success #1</h3>
				<blockquote>
					Athletes must perform with no expectation and replace strict
					expectations with high levels of confidence and manageable objectives
					(or process goals).
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Many athletes find it difficult to perform without any result or
					performance expectations unless I am able to help them replace
					expectations (occupy their mind) with something more conducive to a
					process focus void of the judgments that come with expectations.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many athletes apply a “formula” that I think is a recipe for disaster
					– high expectations and low confidence. Do you expect perfection, but
					do not have the confidence to back it up? It should be just the
					opposite – and this is often a revelation for some of my students when
					I define the terms in my above formula and further discuss the
					ramifications of expectations on performance.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thus, having high confidence and manageable objectives gives you a
					positive, process focus in place of judgmental strict expectations and
					specific outcome-orientated results.
				</p>
				<h4>Therefore, three steps in the formula are:</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Identify strict, unrealistic expectations that affect your
						confidence negatively.
					</li>
					<li>
						Understand how to harness the power of confidence and how confidence
						differs from expectations
					</li>
					<li>
						Replace expectations with manageable objectives. Focus on manageable
						objectives or what I call mini-goals or process goals, but do not
						turn them into expectations.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Let’s take a closer look at these steps in the formula.</p>
				<h3>Step 1: Identify Your Own Limiting Expectations</h3>
				<p>
					This is the most difficult task for many of my students because
					expectations have become a natural part of their mental game and
					performance. When I talk about expectations, I refer to the strict
					demands you place on your performance. Instead of generating
					confidence, expectations become a desperate need for athletes – “I
					MUST finish in the top 10 this week, or the race is a failure.”
				</p>
				<p>
					If you are familiar with my philosophy about mental coaching, you know
					that focusing on results is not the best mindset for peak performance.
				</p>
				<h4>Below are some signs to help identify strict expectations</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Your “goals” focus on outcomes or results only.</li>
					<li>
						You constantly judge your performance based on personal standards.
					</li>
					<li>
						You become upset when you do not perform up to your own standards.
					</li>
					<li>
						You lose confidence when you do not achieve your personal standards.
					</li>
					<li>
						You expect to attain certain game statistics during your
						performance.
					</li>
					<li>
						On the occasion you perform up to your own standards, you feel no
						reward from this because you were “supposed to” perform that well.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>
					Below are a few questions you can ask yourself to flush out any
					expectations:
				</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						What results do you demand of yourself before the competition even
						starts?
					</li>
					<li>
						What personal statistics, such as points per game, do you feel you
						should achieve based on past performances, and would you be upset or
						frustrated if you did not reach these stats?
					</li>
					<li>
						Do you maintain unrealistic “goals” for your performance before
						competition? In which areas do you have to be perfect?
					</li>
					<li>
						Do you try to live up to other people’s expectations? What
						expectations do you adopt or take on from others – parents, coaches,
						or teammates?
					</li>
					<li>
						Do expectations about your scoring (or your team’s scoring) limit
						you when you exceed these expectations, keeping you stuck in a
						comfort zone?
					</li>
					<li>
						Do you generalize today about how you SHOULD perform based on past
						performances?
					</li>
					<li>
						Do you engage in name-calling with yourself or maintain negative
						personal descriptions such as “I’m a choker,” which influence your
						confidence?
					</li>
					<li>
						Are you easily frustrated when you don’t perform up to your minimum
						personal standards? What are the ways you think you should perform?
					</li>
					<li>
						Do you dwell and beat yourself up about how badly you performed?
					</li>
					<li>
						Do you have sudden temper tantrums over small errors during
						competition?
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Step 2: Perform with Confidence - not Expectation</h3>
				<p>
					A priority for your mental game is to focus all your energy on the
					process, also called the present moment, instead of outcomes or
					results. Focusing on results only serves to set expectations on your
					performance. Process goals or what I call manageable objectives help
					you focus attention on execution only, if applied correctly.
				</p>
				<p>
					The next step is to understand confidence and how this differs in its
					application to your performance. Confidence is a belief in your
					ability to execute a task at the most specific level. Confidence can
					also be the general belief in your ability to win or be successful.
				</p>
				<h4>How does confidence differ from expectation?</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Confidence precedes your performance or execution.</li>
					<li>
						Confidence is not judgmental about how well or poorly you are
						performing.
					</li>
					<li>Confidence thrives on momentum and good performance.</li>
					<li>
						Confidence is focused on the present moment and your ability to
						execute instead of the desire for obtaining outcomes or final
						results.
					</li>
					<li>
						Confidence is rational and built from training and past
						performances, expectations are usually irrational and outcome
						focused.
					</li>
					<li>
						Expectations chase results, positive results lead to confidence.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Step 3. Replace Expectations with Process Goals</h3>
				<h4>What are the steps for establishing process goals?</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Decide which aspects of your performance you want to improve or
						focus on that day.
					</li>
					<li>
						Set one or two process goals that will help you focus on execution.
					</li>
					<li>
						If you recognize that you are getting ahead of yourself or thinking
						about results or focused on expectation, refocus on your process
						goals.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>What are examples of process goals?</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Golf: Pick a specific target on every shot</li>
					<li>Tennis: Increase first serve percentage</li>
					<li>Hockey: Focus on quality back checking</li>
					<li>Football: Commit to the play call</li>
					<li>Swimming: Improve rhythm in the pool</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					I think you get the idea now. Process goals focus on the small tasks
					you need to do in the present moment that will help you perform well.
					The purpose of process goals is to help you become immersed in the
					present moment only and not really for the benefit of reaching small
					goals.
				</p>
				<p>
					Do not evaluate or judge if you are achieving your process goals!
					Although it’s rewarding to reach your goals, I don’t want you to
					assess or judge whether you’re on track because they will turn into
					expectations in this case. If you do, you are not focused on the
					process. Later, after the competition ends, you can assess how well
					you did with your process goals. In other words, reflect and evaluate
					on your performance after game time not during the game.
				</p>

				<h3>The Confidence-Expectation Connection</h3>
				<p>
					I hope that you now understand the connection between confidence and
					expectations. You have learned that maintaining strict,
					perfectionistic, or unrealistic expectations can actually damper your
					feelings of confidence, especially when you feel your expectations -
					or the expectations you think others have for you - are not being met.
				</p>
				<p>
					Identifying and replacing expectations with manageable objectives or
					process goals must be a priority for you to develop ultimate
					self-confidence. This booklet is designed to be used in connection
					with “The Confident Athlete.”
				</p>
				<p>
					Take the first step now by identifying the expectations that undermine
					your confidence and limit your performance. This step alone will make
					a big difference in your mental game performance as it does with many
					of my personal coaching students. If you want personal help
					identifying and dispelling your expectations and improving your
					confidence, please contact me via email or phone.
