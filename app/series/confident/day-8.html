				<h3>Day 8 - Warm-up</h3>
				<p>
					Confident athletes have a positive self-image and grasp positive
					labels to describe their ability. Boxing great, Muhammad Ali, was one
					of the best athletes in terms of creating an air of supremacy through
					positive self-labels, in regard to his performance and ability. He
					would say, “I am the greatest,” and he believed it! He turned many
					people off because they interpreted his behavior as arrogant or too
					cocky.
				</p>
				<p>
					You don’t have to go as far as Ali and tell others how great an
					athlete you are, but if you can hold the belief—that is what is most
					important—you’ll view yourself as a great athlete. Envisioning
					yourself as a great athlete is what separates great athletes from good
					ones.

					“Champions aren't made in gyms. Champions are made from something they
					have deep inside them: A desire, a dream, and a vision. They have to
					have last-minute stamina; they have to be a little faster; and they
					have to have the skill and the will. But the will must be stronger
					than the skill.”<cite>~Muhammad Ali</cite>

				<h3>Day 8 - Daily Objective</h3>
				<p>
					To develop a healthy sports self-concept that supports strong
					selfconfidence.

			<section id="boost" class="confident">
				<h3>Day 8 - Daily Confidence Boost</h3>
				<p>
					The goal is to identify negative self-labels and replace these with
					self-labels or beliefs that support your confidence, such as, “I am a
					winner.”
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Write down three positive self-labels that positively describe you
						in your sport, which you can truly believe. Examples: “I’m a winner”
						or “I’m the fastest”.
					</li>
					<li>
						Post these self-descriptions on a mirror, your refrigerator or on
						your desktop where you will see them every day.
					</li>
					<li>
						Strive to identify and discard any negative labels that others have
						given to you or that you have made up yourself; write them on a
						piece of paper, crumple the paper, and throw it away with authority.
					</li>
					<li>
						When speaking to others about yourself and your abilities, use the
						positive self-labels you have formulated with confidence but avoid
						deliberate displays of outward cockiness, because people who lack
						confidence, sometimes resent and do not understand outward displays
						of confidence, which they often interpret as arrogance.
					</li>
					<li>
						Goal: Feeling cocky on the inside, while being humble on the
						outside.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Day 8 - Energize Your Confidence</h3>
				<p>
					You will be guided through a short period of relaxation (an abdominal
					breathing exercise) followed by a simple guided mental imagery
					exercise. In addition, you will repeat the following affirmations to
					yourself three times during the guided imagery exercise.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<mark
							>“Perform like a butterfly – sting like a bee – I choose to
							perform with grace and power and be all that I can be.”</mark
						>
					</li>
					<li>
						<mark
							>“I am the best in this event because my performance in practice
							and competition supports this belief.”</mark
						>
					</li>
					<li>
						<mark
							>“I choose not to focus on labels that others give me. I choose to
							see myself as a focused and mentally tough competitor.”</mark

				<h3>Day 8 - Taking Confident Action</h3>
				<p>
					Write a list of 5 or 6 positive self-descriptors you can recite, that
					you can honestly believe in, that will support self-confidence. If you
					do not know where to begin, it may help to start by using positive
					labels or comments others have given you. What are the positive
					descriptions others have given you about your game or performance?
