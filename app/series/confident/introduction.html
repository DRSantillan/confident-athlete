				<h3>
					A 14-Day Plan for Ultimate Self- Confidence.
				</h3>
				<p>
					Self-confidence is THE NUMBER ONE ASSET that separates great athletes
					from the rest of the pack. Athletes CANNOT reach true athletic
					potential without massive amounts of confidence in their game(s) and
					abilities. Most athletes who seek my services do so because they
					desire to know how to improve confidence; have a “fragile” state of
					confidence; or their confidence has been challenged by a difficult
					experience or encounter.
				</p>

				<p>
					The Confident Athlete represents everything I teach my individual
					students and teams to help them improve and develop massive amounts of
					confidence quickly and maintain it over the long term. I share all of
					my insights, hold nothing back and teach my system for learning
					ultimate self-confidence to any athlete serious about improving his or
					her confidence!
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					“A motto and philosophy that I have really stressed is [SIC];; you’ve
					got to believe in yourself. Self confidence is without a doubt the
					first step to success.” ~ Tommy Lasorda, Baseball Manager, Hall of
					Fame
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Confidence is important for every athlete. However, understanding how
					you can develop confidence daily is the most relevant approach to
					boosting your confidence. What I have learned through working with
					athletes at all levels is that athletes must take responsibility for
					improving confidence just like they work at developing a perfect
					backhand, pitch, swing, stroke and so forth. Athletes must also have a
					clear understanding about the beliefs, thoughts, and expectations that
					consistently undermine confidence.
				</p>
				<p>
					Confidence development is a two part package. In one respect, athletes
					need to focus on their strengths and maintain confident-enhancing
					thoughts about their sport even in the face of adversity. And, in
					another respect, athletes must understand how to identify the beliefs,
					thoughts or expectations that undermine or hold back their confidence.

				<h3>How to use this program</h3>
				<p>
					Each day you are given specific tasks to complete to help you build
					confidence. At the end of 14 days, you should be on your way to
					ultimate confidence, but it is important to keep up the strategies I
					share with you far beyond 14 days to gain the most benefit from the
					program.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each day of the 14-day program is divided into sections of various
					tasks which you should complete. To gain the most confidence from each
					daily booster, you should complete all the tasks each day.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition to the daily tasks, use the audio program that came with
					The Confident Athlete to help guide you through your confidence
					program each day. Listen to the audio for Day 1 and then complete the
					workbook exercises before proceeding to the Day 2 audio.
				</p>
				<p>
					See Table 1 on the following page for a description of each section
					for each day of the 14-day program.
