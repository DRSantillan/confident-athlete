					Congratulations! You have completed The Confident Athlete. The new,
					confident you is on your way to ultimate self-confidence. You should
					be proud of yourself for taking action with your mental game to be the
					most confident athlete you can be.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, I need you to take more action now; MASSIVE action right now.
					You are armed with the information and tools to mold your confidence
					and take your mental game to a new level. But, this is just the
					beginning, a new beginning for you to rocket your confidence to new
					heights.
				</p>
				<p>
					I tell all my mental coaching students that learning is a three part
					process. The first part is the ability to understand the mental
					strategies that will help improve your mental game. The second stage
					is the ability to apply your mental strategies to your sport daily.
				</p>
				<p>
					The third and final stage is your ability to commit, over the long
					haul, to improving your confidence and mental attitude. Your learning
					is never complete without the diligence to stay committed to your
					mental training program.
				</p>
				<p>
					My suggestion is to review The Confident Athlete at least once a month
					and more often if necessary. Use the confidence scoreboard at the end
					of each section to help test your ability to apply the concepts after
					every competition. On the following page, I have included a summary of
					the action plans for each day of the 14 day program that will help you
					take action daily. Remove this page from your workbook and post it
					where you can see it every day. You should review these action plans
					often and work daily to apply 1-2 of the concepts to your practice,
					training, and competition!
				</p>
				<p>
					On the following page, you will find the final taking confident action
					commitment contract that you should review and sign now. Warning: if
					you sign the contract, be prepared to take massive action!
