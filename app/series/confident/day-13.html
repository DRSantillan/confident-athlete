				<h3>Day 13 - Warm-up</h3>
				<p>
					You must start with the realization that most intimidation in sports
					is selfinduced. Yes, other athletes will sometimes use direct
					intimidation or play head games with you, but you can make the choice
					to not pay attention and look the other way.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, you can’t “look the other way” when you are your own worst
					enemy because you are intimidated by your own thoughts about the level
					of the competition, the weather conditions, or the venue you play.
					Athletes who lack confidence often look for others to help them feel
					confident. Likewise, these same athletes intimidate themselves by
					paying too much attention to other competitors or by putting other
					competitors on a pedestal.

				<h3>Day 13 - Confidence Clip</h3>
				<blockquote>
					"I never was intimidated as a football player. That never was an
					issue. You want to have success, and I have been able to learn that
					early in my career. Intimidation just doesn’t play a factor.
					Basically, when you have good chemistry and confidence, even more than
					last year, intimidation does not play a factor."

				<h3>Day 13 - Daily Confidence Boost</h3>
				<p>
					Most self-induced intimidation comes from you giving too much energy
					to other competitors by making comparisons, thinking too much about
					the reputation of your competitors, or feeling like you do not belong
					at your current level of play.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Avoid putting other athletes on a pedestal, as if they are better
						than you or superior.
					</li>
					<li>
						Stop making comparisons to athletes who you think are better than
						you.
					</li>
					<li>
						Focus on your strengths instead thinking about the reputation of
						other competitors and how you stack up.
					</li>
					<li>See yourself on equal ground in terms of your ability.</li>
