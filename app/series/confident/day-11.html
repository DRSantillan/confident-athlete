				<h3>Day 11 - Warm-up</h3>
				<p>
					Do you become rattled by unanticipated events that happen during
					competition? Confident athletes do not lose composure when faced with
					uncertain challenges in competition. I teach my students to anticipate
					as many challenges as possible, based on what has happened in the past
					and address their major fears.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some regular and unusual challenges to anticipate may include
					difficult weather conditions, unfair officiating, rude spectators,
					psych-out attempts from competitors, poor play, bad luck, unexpected
					equipment problems and any other distractions you may encounter. Being
					mentally prepared to cope with any distraction or challenge, rather
					than viewing them as inhibiting obstacles, is very important to ensure
					your confidence in the upcoming competition.

				<h3>Day 11 - Confidence Clip</h3>
				<blockquote>
					“I think it is important to have an instinct for things, but also what
					is very important is to be able to try to read a potential trouble
					situation. Such as, all of a sudden you are coming into a lot of
					traffic and guys are dicing all over the place and you figure I wonder
					what the heck is going to happen here. What if this happens, that
					happens? So you have to be vigilant sometimes you can’t help yourself
					you can’t just go in there blind with the attitude everything is going
					to be alright, ‘no way is he going to come down on me’. You have to
					think of the worst possible scenario and be able to react to it so you
					can save yourself.”

				<h3>Day 11 - Daily Objective</h3>
				<p>
					To learn how to anticipate distractions before they happen by planning
					a coping response.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section class="boost">
				<h3>Day 11 - Daily Confidence Boost</h3>
				<p>
					Use the four step process below to help you anticipate and cope with
					potential trouble situations.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Think back to when you got sidetracked by unanticipated distractions
						during competition.
					</li>
					<li>Prepare a written list of those distractions.</li>
					<li>
						Record the situation, the distraction and your reaction to the
						event.
					</li>
					<li>
						Formulate and write down a coping response you could use to react
						more appropriately in case the same distraction presents itself in
						the future. How will you react to distracting events in a way that
						helps you play on with focus, confidence and composure?
					</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>Example Coping Strategy</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Distraction:</strong>A fan in the stands starts to ride you
						when you are up to bat and you change your focus to his heckling.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Situation:</strong>You are up to bat with 2 men on base.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Coping action:</strong>You notice that you are focusing on
						unimportant cues to getting a hit. You decide to ask yourself what
						do you need to think about right now to have a successful at bat?
						You know that you must dig in and focus intensely on the pitcher and
						picking up the ball.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section class="energize">
				<h3>Day 11 - Energize Your Confidence</h3>
				<p>
					You will be guided through a short period of relaxation (an abdominal
					breathing exercise) followed by a simple guided mental imagery
					exercise. In addition, you will repeat the following affirmations to
					yourself three times during the guided imagery exercise.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<mark
							>“Nothing will rattle my composure because I am ready for
							anything.”</mark
						>
					</li>
					<li>
						<mark
							>“I have prepared myself to handle any adversity that comes my
							way.”</mark
						>
					</li>
					<li>
						<mark
							>“I choose to stay composed and confident in crunch-time.”</mark
						>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			<section class="action">
				<h3>Day 11 - Taking Confident Action</h3>
				<p>
					You can also practice your coping plan by using mental imagery. Think
					back to the time when you had something unexpected happen to you and
					it became a distraction. In your mental imagery, use your coping
					reaction to regain your composure or refocus.
