				<h3>Day 9 - Warm-up</h3>
				<p>
					Every person carries on an internal dialogue, which is known as
					“self-talk”. Your self-talk can be positive—“I will play well today”—
					or negative— “I hope I don’t embarrass myself and lose the game
					today.” You want to bring awareness to any negative self-talk you
					maintain after you make a mistake.
				</p>
				<p>
					Why do some athletes use positive self-talk and pick themselves up
					after a mistake, while other athletes beat up on themselves for not
					performing up to expectations? Positive athletes are aware that they
					must adopt a mentality that supports confidence instead of reinforcing
					doubt.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is really important—positive athletes develop mindsets that
					support confidence. You can also be proactive with your confidence by
					maintaining positive self-talk before, during AND after performance.

					"I'm thinking about making every putt that I hit. I use my self-talk

				<h3>Day 9 - Daily Confidence Boost</h3>
				<p>
					Below are five steps to identify the correct positive self-talk to use
					prior to your performance. You can use this at any time before you
					compete, such as before a gymnastics routine or during your
					performance, such as when you are on a break away in hockey.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Think back to the last time you performed your best and were in the
						zone.
					</li>
					<li>
						What was your self-talk like? What things did you think about or
						tell yourself about your performance?
					</li>
					<li>
						Now, develop a list of positive statements from your best
						performance, such as, “You are the best competitor today.”
					</li>
					<li>Write these statements below.</li>
					<li>
						Use your mental rehearsal to experience yourself in your next
						competition by frequently repeating positive statements.
