				<h3>Day 13 - Warm-up</h3>
				<p>
					In the last lesson, I introduced the concept of emotional control for
					dealing with setbacks and why this is important for composure.
					Emotional composure is enhanced when you take a non-judgmental and
					accepting attitude into competition. Emotional control is the ability
					to stay even tempered, level headed, or have a calm mind even when you
					are challenged by mishaps or mistakes. But, what few athletes
					recognize is that emotional control strategies begin before you enter
					competition.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many athletes perceive that they are victims of their circumstances –
					if the tennis player double faults, for example, it’s the double fault
					that causes emotional turmoil. The problem lies in being reactive
					instead of proactive when faced with adversity during a game. If you
					buy into the belief: “I have no control over my emotions and I cannot
					help feeling upset when the game does not happen according to my
					plan,” you are prone to lose control. This irrational belief causes
					you to feel helpless without any control over your circumstances.
				</p>
				<p>
					I teach my students that they have a free-will and have the choice to
					react to adversity with composure instead of helplessness or out of
					negative habits. This means using proactive strategies to cope with
					adversity instead of reacting out of ineffective habits. Proactive
					athletes plan and strategize how they will cope with mishaps or trying
					situations when they aren’t in the midst of the emotions of the crisis
					moment. They learn preset mental strategies to help them stay composed
					and react with emotional stability – and this is the goal of today’s
					lesson.

				<h3>Day 13 - Composure Clip</h3>

				<blockquote>
					“I would lose my composure and sometimes completely blow it on the
					court…it was very hard to rebound and get back in the game. My temper
					got in the way of being in a focused tennis mind; it became very
					destructive.”

				<h3>Day 13 - Daily Composure Boost</h3>
				<p>
					My approach to helping you react with emotional composure during or
					after adversity is to look at your thought process (or beliefs) about
					setbacks that happen to you. First, we want to identify situations
					that potentially can cause you to become upset.
				</p>
				<p>
					You completed this task in Table 16 in the last lesson – Day 12.
					Another way to complete this exercise is to identify the top five
					frustrating things that happen to you during competition.
				</p>
				<p>
					A golfer might say three-putting, for example. The tennis play might
					say it’s the double-fault. The quarterback might say throwing an
					interception is one of the most frustrating events. List your top five
					frustrations as they relate to your sport(s) below.

					Borrowing from a famous psychologist Albert Ellis, he would say that,
					people are not frustrated or upset about by events that happen to
					them, but rather they become upset or disturbed by the way people
					think about them. He would say that the fact you make a “mistake” such
					as a three-putt is not frustrating in itself. Rather, frustration
					comes from how you perceive the “event” and what beliefs you maintain
					about the event or mistake.
				</p>
				<p>
					This means we need to modify the old habits or ways of thinking about
					mistakes so you can be more composed. This requires that you learn how
					to disagree with (or dispute) your thoughts or beliefs about mistakes
					and replace these with more functional ways of thinking, which will
					lead to improved emotional control.
				</p>
				<h4>4 Steps to Better Emotional Control:</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<strong>List</strong> an event or mistake that causes you
						frustration.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Identify</strong> the beliefs or thoughts you maintain that
						cause you frustration.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Replace</strong> the belief or thoughts with ones that will
						help you play on with composure.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Proactively practice</strong> your coping strategies (or new
						beliefs) prior to competition.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>Here is an example of the process:</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>The mistake: 3-putting in golf</li>
					<li>
						The belief that causes frustration: “I am too good to 3-putt from 30
						feet. I will never shoot a good score if I keep doing that!”
					</li>
					<li>
						Your revised thinking about this mistake: “Even the best players in
						the world 3-putt occasionally. I will recover and putt well the rest
						of the day.”
					</li>
					<li>
						Practice this coping strategy in your regular training. You can also
						imagine making the mistake and applying your new thinking process.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					The goal is to improve your thinking about mistakes so you can play on
					with composure. I tell my students to find a way to make the mistakes
					“OK” in their own mind. This is an accepting mindset. I am not saying
					mistakes are OK, I am pointing out the fact that you must accept it –
					any way you can – so you can move on with a free mind to the next
					shot, play, or point.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now it’s your turn to challenge or dispute your thoughts that cause
					you to feel frustrated:
