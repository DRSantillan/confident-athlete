				<h3>Day 5 - Warm-up</h3>
				<p>
					I want to dig down deeper into your mind and uncover another type of
					mental breakdown that causes you to feel pressure and then sabotages
					your performance – irrational beliefs.
				</p>
				<p>
					Irrational beliefs are thoughts, feelings, ideas, attitudes, or
					ingrained ways of behaving that are self-defeating and often not based
					on reality. They are often made-up stories in your mind, and similar
					to the process of mind reading, create additional stress, anxiety, or
					worry about your performance.
				</p>
				<p>
					How are irrational beliefs related to composure? Let me give you a
					real-life example:
				</p>
				<p>
					At the time I was drafting The Composed Athlete, I received a phone
					call from one of my racing students who was dealing with the issue of
					irrational beliefs. His challenge was that he viewed winning as
					success and anything less as failure. He was using all or none
					thinking. If he was passed on the track or did not have a chance to
					win, he became frustrated and stopped trying altogether. Needless to
					say, his irrational beliefs were chipping away at his ability to
					perform. As you can see, this type of thinking can sabotage any
					athlete.

				<h3>Day 5 - Composure Clip</h3>
				<blockquote>
					“I like performing in front of others. I don’t put extra pressure on
					myself to perform well for them. I want my fans to enjoy themselves,
					but I don’t feel an overwhelming sense of having to perform well in
					front of other people. I have golf in perspective so it’s not a burden
					to play great golf.”<cite>~Meg Mallon, LPGA Tour</cite>

					To understand and eradicate irrational beliefs that cause undue

				<h3>Day 5 - Daily Composure Boost</h3>
				<p>
					The first goal is to become aware of your own self-defeating beliefs –
					this is a big step in itself – you must be able to put your finger on
					the beliefs that cause you to feel anxious or frustrated. The next
					step is to change your beliefs and develop a new attitude or a new
					philosophy about your sport, so you can remove the mental handcuffs.
				</p>
				<h4>The Top Irrational Beliefs in Sports:</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Perfectionism</li>
					<li>Attaching Self-Worth to Achievement</li>
					<li>Self-Conscious Behavior</li>
					<li>All or None Thinking</li>
					<li>Over-Generalization</li>
					<li>Negative Self-Labels</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Below in Table 7, I have listed the top six irrational or unhealthy
					beliefs - identified above. Your task is to identify your own
					unhealthy beliefs, based on the examples provided and the questions
					posed in this exercise.

					Your next task is to change your unhealthy beliefs that cause anxiety
					or pressure into healthy statements. This can be a difficult task if
					the belief is one that you have held on to all your life.
				</p>
				<p>
					The process begins by questioning yourself about these beliefs, a
					personal rebuttal to your own beliefs. Below is an example….
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Unhealthy belief:</strong> “If I don’t finish first in the
						race, I am a loser.”
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Rebuttal and healthy belief:</strong> “Winning does not make
						me a better person and losing does not mean I am a loser in life. I
						am not perfect and can’t win every race I enter. I accept this. I am
						a good person no matter if I win or lose in sport.”
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Look carefully at the beliefs that stifle your ability to perform with
					composure, confidence, focus, and consistency. Once you can identify
					these negative beliefs, it is easier to accept that change is
					necessary. Then, it is simply a matter of adapting your mindset by
					replacing irrational beliefs with healthy ones by taking an objective
					or rational approach.
