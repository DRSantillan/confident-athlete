				<h3>Day 12 - Warm-up</h3>
				<p>
					Emotional control is essential to peak performance in sports.
					Emotional control is a huge facet of composure. So far, the lessons
					have focused on dealing with competitive pressure, intimidation, and
					anxiety. Every athlete at one time has become upset, frustrated, or
					angry at his or herself (or other people). How you perform will depend
					on your ability to let go and stay composed after errors.
				</p>
				<p>
					Emotional control and letting go of errors is such an important mental
					skill in sports psychology that I have devoted two lessons to this
					topic. Many fine athletes sabotage their own performance because they
					do not have the skills to cope with adversity and have not learned the
					skills to control their emotions. Highly motivated athletes with
					perfectionistic tendencies are particularly prone to becoming upset
					and frustrated with mistakes or when not performing up to
					expectations.
				</p>
				<p>
					What is emotional control? Emotional control is the ability to stay
					even tempered, level headed, or have a calm mind when you are
					challenged by mishaps or adversity. Even the top athletes in the world
					can become upset with their performance, but they are able to stay in
					control and get back to business or execution quickly, and that’s what
					separates the great athletes who recover from mistakes from the good
					athlete who cracks and is lost for the remainder of the competition.
				</p>
				<p>
					One important point to keep in mind: No one person (or event that
					occurs) can make you feel frustrated but yourself! Yes, you might feel
					frustrated by striking out when your team most needs you, or missing a
					short putt that costs you the match win. However, you must understand
					that it’s not the strike out or missed putt that causes frustration,
					rather it’s your belief or perception about these events that creates
					frustration.

					“Match play is different…. If you make a mistake, you start thinking

					patience or lose your composure real quick because you start seeing
					the match slip away and start playing too hard.”

				<h3>Day 12 - Daily Composure Boost</h3>

				<p>
					I teach my students to approach emotional composure two ways: (1)
					taking a supportive pregame mindset into competition and (2) learning
					to let go of errors before emotions snowball out of control. You have
					to both prepare an accepting mindset before you compete and arm
					yourself with mental strategies to cope your best.
				</p>
				<p>
					What is the correct mindset you should take to competition to be more
					accepting of yourself? A mindset void of expectation and free of
					judgment for starters. The first step is to identify strict
					expectations that cause you to lose your composure when you think that
					you expectations are not met. Let’s begin with a test of your
					knowledge of the terms in table 15 below.
				</p>
				<h4>Table 15. Matching Game – Definitions of Basic Terms</h4>
				<div class="container">

					<div class="container__row">

						<div class="container__col">

					<div class="container__row">

							3. Frustration

					<div class="container__row">

						</div>
						<div class="container__col">
							D. Beliefs or thoughts that are not grounded in reality and are
							guesses on your part.
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="container__row">
						<div class="container__col container__row-title">
							5. Negative Emotions
						</div>
						<div class="container__col">
							E. Thinking about a past error repeatedly and thus the mind is
							stuck in the past.
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="container__row">
						<div class="container__col container__row-title">6. Mistake</div>
						<div class="container__col">
							F. Unhealthy feelings or thoughts you maintain about your
							performance.
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>
					One of your mental game objectives is to play without expectations
					that can cause you to become easily frustrated if you don’t match your
					own expectations.
				</p>
				<p>Expectations that can lead to feelings of frustration include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I must play perfectly to be successful today.</li>
					<li>
						I expect to perform perfectly today and if I don’t, I am worthless.
					</li>
					<li>I cannot make any mistakes if I want to win.</li>
					<li>To play my best, I must have an error-free performance.</li>
					<li>I expect my teammates to be perfect and not make errors.</li>
					<li>
						I should get upset when I make errors to show others that I am
						really a better athlete.
					</li>
					<li>I won’t encounter any bad luck.</li>
					<li>
						If I make a mistake, I should automatically be upset or frustrated.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					As you can tell from this list of expectations, you would have little
					room to NOT BE PERFECT. How often have you performed perfectly or had
					a perfect game? Not often, maybe never. Now it’s your turn. Please
					list the expectations you maintain going into competition that if you
					do not achieve, you become upset, angry, or frustrated with your play.
					(Answers to matching game: 1-C, 2-E, 3-A, 4-D, 5-F, 6-B)

					Part of mental preparation is preparing your mind to cope with
					anything that could happen during competition in which would cause you
					to lose your composure or become frustrated. You can start by
					reviewing your past performances when you lost your composure. Has an
					opponent tried to psych you out with negative comments? Have you ever
					lost control on a referee for making a bad call? Do you get upset when
					your coach yells at you for mistakes? You get the idea.
				</p>
				<p>
					In your next lesson, I will give you a system for coping with errors
					when they happen, but for now I want you to anticipate situations that
					may rattle your cage and cause you to lose your composure.
