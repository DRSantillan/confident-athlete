					Congratulations! You have completed The Composed Athlete. The new,
					composed you is now on your way to maximum composure. You should be
					proud of yourself for taking action with your mental game to be the
					most composed athlete you can be and committed to excellence in
					sports. Take a moment to congratulate the efforts you have made so
					far!
				</p>
				<p>
					I need you to take real action now! You are armed with the powerful
					information and tools to help you improve composure and cope with
					setbacks, which is an excellent first step! But, this is just the
					beginning to rocket your self-composure to new heights. Now your goal
					is to apply this to your sport on a daily basis.
				</p>
				<p>I inform all my mental game coaching students that learning any skills, especially
mental skills, is a three part process. The first part is the ability to understand the
mental strategies that will help improve your mental game. The second stage is the
ability to apply your mental strategies to your sport daily. The third and final stage
is your ability to commit, over the long term – months and months, to improve
your focus and mental attitude. Your learning is never complete without the
diligence to stay committed to your mental training program.</p>
				<p>My suggestion is to review The Composed Athlete at least once a month and
more often if necessary. Use the “Scoreboard” sections at the end of each session
after every performance to help you identify areas to improve. On the following
page, I have included a summary of the action plans for each day of the 14-day
program that will help you take action daily. Remove this page from your workbook
and post it where you can see it every day. You should review these action plans
often and work daily to apply 1-2 of the concepts to your practice, training, and
competition! On the following page, you will find the final Taking Composed Action
commitment contract that you should review and sign now. Warning: if you sign the
contract, be prepared to take massive action!</p>
