				<h3>Day 10 - Warm-up</h3>
				<p>
					What do you think about when I mention intimidation? Do you think
					about that bully at school who intimidated all his classmates? Do you
					visualize becoming intimidated by an opponent that is verbally
					harassing you? Or, do you think about your own inner bully that uses
					intimidation to sabotage your performance?
				</p>
				<p>
					Some athletes resort to intentional intimidation such as verbal abuse
					or even bullying. Some athletes become intimidated by their own
					negative thoughts or fears that turn into pressure and mental
					gremlins. These “internal” intimidators are detrimental to peak
					performance and are known as self-intimidation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Self-intimidation is what you bring on yourself because you worry
					about your competition or the team you are about to play. From my
					perspective, selfintimidation is the most common type of intimidation
					in sports and is also the hardest intimidation to overcome. Why? You
					can easily ignore what others say to you, but you can’t ignore your
					own self-talk!
				</p>
				<p>
					Confident and composed athletes usually do not intimidate themselves.
					Instead, they are in control of their emotions and love the challenge
					of testing their skills against others athletes. The bigger and better
					the challenge, the more enjoyment they gain from the competition.
				</p>
				<p>
					Athletes who become self-intimidated feel anxious, scared, and
					pressured to perform their best if they want to win. They worry about
					performing against other athletes who are just as skilled. They
					sometimes compare themselves to better athletes. Making comparisons to
					athletes who you think are better than you, causes a lack of
					confidence and produces feelings of inferiority.

				<h3>Day 10 - Daily Composure Boost</h3>
				<p>
					Athletes can intimidate themselves in many ways, but it usually deals
					with how you perceive your skills compared to the skills of the
					competition. The most common ways that you may feel intimidated are:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Your opponent has an intimidating presence or look of confidence
					</li>
					<li>
						You do not feel like you belong, you feel out of place or lack
						confidence
					</li>
					<li>The reputation or record of your opponent precedes him or her</li>
					<li>
						You are in awe or put others on a pedestal or are “star-struck”
					</li>
					<li>
						You have advanced to a higher level of competition where everyone is
						just as good as you are if not better
					</li>
					<li>You are in awe of the situation or environment</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					As you can imagine, self-intimidation happens when you give your
					opponent too much power or attention by putting your competitors on a
					pedestal. When you feel intimidated you may relate to the following:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Anxious or scared about outcomes</li>
					<li>Doubt or lack of confidence in your ability</li>
					<li>Feel as if you don’t belong at the event</li>
					<li>Want to go hide and slip away unnoticed</li>
					<li>Afraid to embarrass yourself</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Did I cover all your feelings associated with intimidation? Please
					list others feelings you have when intimidated by the competition or a
					new situation:

				<h4>No More Intimidation!</h4>
				<p>
					It should be clear to you now that self-intimidation happens because
					you either (1) focus too much on the competition or (2) you compare
					your skills, ability, or history to that of your competitors. Your
					first task is to avoid making comparisons to your competitors, which
					means you should not concern yourself with the reputation or status of
					whom you will compete against. Your second task is to avoid focusing
					on your competition at all unless your observations are important for
					strategy or game plans.
				</p>
				<p>
					With self-intimidation, most of this is in your mind. That means you
					are choosing to focus on the wrong thoughts and images prior to and
					during competition. Most intimidation begins prior to competition as
					you gawk in awe or worry about your inability to beat your opponent.
				</p>
				<p>
					If it begins in the mind, we can stop it before intimidating thoughts
					get out of control. I don’t like to go on a “no” campaign, but I think
					this lesson warrants drastic measures! Complete your own “stop the
					internal bully” statements at the end of Table 12.
