				<h3>Day 6 - Warm-up</h3>
				<p>
					Fear of failure is a huge topic in sports psychology because many
					over-motivated, perfectionist athletes have some form of fear of
					failure. What is fear of failure?
				</p>
				<p>
					The best athletes in the world perform without the constraints of
					fear. But, that is because they have learned to master and control
					their thoughts, so that they can remain focused in the present,
					instead of dwelling on the past, or anticipating the future.
				</p>
				<p>
					Several mental game issues are linked to fear of failure, such as low
					selfconfidence, needless worry about making mistakes, fear of
					rejection or embarrassment, and the list goes on.
				</p>
				<p>
					Fears related to the fear of failure can be both rational (I don’t
					want to fall off the high bar”) and irrational (“I’m worried that
					others won’t like me if I’m not perfect”). Thus, today’s lesson ties
					in with your previous lesson on irrational beliefs.

				<h3>Day 6 - Daily Composure Boost</h3>
				<p>
					Step one is to identify the typical fears that athletes maintain in
					sports today. Most of these fears are born out of an intense need or
					desire to succeed. It may seem odd that fear of failure actually comes
					from a strong desire to succeed, but most fear of failure starts with
					a very motivated and determined individual who badly wants to win,
					achieve status, or be recognized for their achievements. The problem,
					however, is that this desire to win or be recognized actually results
					in the athlete focusing too much on the future and freezing up out of
					fear that his or her goals won’t be met.
				</p>
				<h4>What are the common fears associated with the fear of failure?</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Fear of losing a match, game, or race</li>
					<li>Fear of embarrassment</li>
					<li>Fear of letting others down</li>
					<li>Fear of not playing up to one’s potential</li>
					<li>Fear of not meeting expectations of others</li>
					<li>
						Fear of exhaustive efforts and not receiving any “pay off” for the
						hard work
					</li>
					<li>Fear of negative social evaluation</li>
					<li>Fear of not being accepted by others or not gaining approval</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The more you want to succeed, the harder it is to handle failure and
					the more you avoid it. In table 9, please check off the statements
					that are applicable to you.

				<p>
					The underlying causes for fear of failure can be classified into two
					main categories:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Fear of negative results or consequences (e.g. Fear of losing, fear
						of not performing during crunch time, etc.)
					</li>
					<li>
						Fear of not getting approval, acceptance or respect from others
						(Fear of letting down the team, coach, spectators or a parent.)
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					If you have identified three or more signs of fear of failure on the
					test in table 9, it is safe to say you have some form of fear of
					failure. Questions to consider:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Are you afraid of what others may think of how you are performing?
					</li>
					<li>
						Are you afraid of investing your time into practice and hard work,
						but in the end not reaping the benefit of your extended practices?
					</li>
					<li>
						Do you want to win so badly that you become anxious about the
						outcome and your performance suffers?
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Once you identify the specific fear, you must address it head on
					instead of just recognizing and trying to mask the symptoms in which
					fear manifests itself such as, anxiety, tension, and over-cautious
					play. Use reason and rationality to convince yourself that the fear is
					irrational and not based on fact.
				</p>
				<h4>Tips for Challenging your Fear of Failure:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Dispute the importance of your fear in the bigger picture of life.
						Does it really matter when you put it into perspective?
					</li>
					<li>
						Question the rationality of your fear – is it grounded in reality?
					</li>
					<li>
						Does holding on to this fear help you perform better or is it a
						functional necessity to your success?
					</li>
					<li>
						Are you procrastinating – hoping your fear will disappear on its
						own?
					</li>
					<li>
						Is this fear an absolute (written in stone) with no options to
						change?
					</li>
					<li>
						Do others encourage you to hold on to this belief unknowingly?
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Essentially, fear of failure focuses on all the wrong areas to be
					successful in sports. In the next lesson, I discuss how to be
					success-driven, not fear of failure driven.
