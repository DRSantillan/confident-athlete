				<h3>Taking Fearless Action – My Commitment Contract</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
	<li><strong>I commit</strong> to mentally rehearsing what it feels like to be my composed model athlete.</li>
	<li><strong>I commit</strong> to recognizing when I am committing mental game errors and to become more
aware of mental breakdowns that undermine composure.</li>
	<li><strong>I commit</strong> to accepting that I can’t be perfect as an athlete.</li>
	<li><strong>I commit</strong> to accepting that it’s OK and natural to make mistakes.</li>
	<li><strong>I commit</strong> to stop the mind reading of what I think others expect of me.</li>
	<li><strong>I commit</strong> to recognizing when I crave approval from others via my performance, and
know the only opinion that matters is my own!</li>
	<li><strong>I commit</strong> to replacing my irrational thoughts about my performance with new, healthy
beliefs.</li>
	<li><strong>I commit</strong> to identifying fears I hold on to that hold me back from performing to my full
potential or ability.</li>
	<li><strong>I will</strong> challenge my fears and replace them with growth-oriented statements.</li>
	<li><strong>I commit</strong> to setting success-driven goals that will focus my mind on achieving what I
want instead of what dwelling on the past or predicting the future.</li>
	<li><strong>I commit</strong> to identifying negative self-images and replacing them with a strong, confident
self-image.</li>
	<li><strong>I commit</strong> to breaking free of any self-imposed comfort zones that hold me back.</li>
	<li><strong>I commit</strong> to being the intimidator instead of letting others intimidate me.</li>
	<li><strong>I commit</strong> to focusing only on the thoughts I can control in my sport experience.</li>
	<li><strong>I commit</strong> to note any unrealistic expectations that may leave me feeling frustrated if I
don’t achieve them.</li>
	<li><strong>I commit</strong> to reacting to errors with full composure and quickly letting them go from my
mind.</li>
	<li><strong>I commit</strong> to use my pre-determined coping strategies for letting go of errors on a daily
basis.</li>
	<li><strong>I commit</strong> to using the pregame routine to help me develop a composed attitude.</li>
