				<h3>Day 9 - Warm-up</h3>
				<p>
					I believe many athletes and performers limit their talents with
					so-called comfort zones, which is a type of mental barrier that is
					hard to break through. A comfort zone becomes a problem whenever an
					athlete is playing better than expected or is breaking new ground.
				</p>
				<p>
					A comfort zone is a mental barrier an athlete sets in his own mind
					based on preconceived notions and expectations about what is and what
					is not possible to achieve.
				</p>
				<p>
					Athletes from other sports also lose composure when performing beyond
					a comfort zone. Similar to the golfer in the example above, when an
					athlete or team feels out of place (winning a game they expected to
					lose) or in new uncharted territory, the tendency is to either become
					anxious and scared or defensive and protective. Composure is
					challenged when an athlete or team compares how they are performing to
					how they expect to perform.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					Preconceived notions about what might be possible, likely, or typical
					for one’s performance turn into a mental barrier that is often hard to
					shake.
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Therefore, part of developing maximum composure for crunch-time
					performances is the ability to perform without the mental handcuffs of
					a comfort zone.

				<h3>Day 9 - Daily Composure Boost</h3>
				<p>
					Begin by assessing your behavior when affected by a comfort zone. We
					do this by recognizing the signs that you are limiting your success
					with a comfort zone. The mental barriers of a comfort zone can affect
					athletes in various ways. Below are the most common symptoms that a
					comfort zone is impacting your performance.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						You get nervous, anxious, or afraid when playing better than
						expected.
					</li>
					<li>
						You compare how you are presently doing with how you expected to do
						before you started the competition.
					</li>
					<li>
						You “sit on your lead” and play defensively; not wanting to risk
						your current position, lead, score, etc.
					</li>
					<li>
						You are in “protect-the-lead” mode, such as when the golfer doesn’t
						want to give back a shot, the race driver protects his lead, the
						tennis player doesn’t want to drop a game when up 5-0, and the
						hockey team tries to maintain its 3-0 lead.
					</li>
					<li>
						You are in a hurry for the competition to finish because you don’t
						want your lead to disappear.
					</li>
					<li>
						You doubt whether you can maintain your lead and lose
						self-confidence.
					</li>
					<li>
						You worry about what others will think if/when you screw up a big
						lead.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Next, develop a solution by learning how to play without the mental
					constraints of a comfort zone. In Table 11 below, you will find a list
					of mental traps of the comfort zone in the left column. On the right,
					is a solution to each comfort zone mental trap. Your mission, if you
					choose to accept, is to match the correct mental strategy (fix) with
					the trap on the left.
