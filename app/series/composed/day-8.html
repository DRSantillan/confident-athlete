				<h3>Day 8 - Warm-up</h3>
				<p>
					You can’t perform your best or have maximum composure unless you have
					a strong foundation of self-confidence. I often discuss how doubt is
					the polar opposite of confidence – if you doubt your ability, you
					don’t have full confidence. Likewise, when you are not confident in
					your ability to perform well it opens the door for you to feel
					anxious, scared, worried, or apprehensive about your performance or
					the outcome of competition.
				</p>
				<p>
					What is self-confidence and how do you become confident?
					Self-confidence is simply the strength of your belief that you can
					successfully execute a skill in the present moment (for more
					information on self-confidence see The Confident Athlete Program).
					Self-confidence is knowing you have done the homework preparation
					through training and practice to succeed at your level and can win.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many forms of confidence exist. Confidence in your ability to stay
					composed is another important step to be in control of your emotions
					and react appropriately to mistakes and errors. The opposite can also
					be true in that some athletes repeatedly choke, become unglued
					emotionally in crunch time, and can never seem to be able to finish
					off a close competition. Thus they have very low self-confidence in
					their ability to display and apply the fundamentals of composure.

					“I was one of the best players as a junior. When I stepped on the

				<h3>Day 8 - Daily Objective</h3>
				<p>
					To learn how to develop a positive self-image of yourself as a
					composed athlete and improve your confidence in your mental game
					ability to perform with composure.
				</p>

				<h3>Day 8 - Daily Composure Boost</h3>
				<p>
					Do you see yourself as a choker? Do you view yourself as someone that
					crumbles under the pressure? Do you think that you are a hothead and
					have no control over your emotions after setbacks or mistakes? If you
					answered yes to any of these questions, then you need to change how
					you view yourself (self-image) as a performer or athlete.
				</p>
				<p>
					Because you purchased The Composed Athlete program I suspect that you
					want to make positive changes to gain, keep and maintain your
					composure. This requires that I help you to (1) improve your
					self-image as a composed athlete and (2) help you gain confidence in
					yourself as a composed athlete, which is the overall aim of this
					program.
				</p>
				<p>
					Lets start by identifying some negative self-labels (names you give
					yourself that are not helpful), which undermine any confidence you may
					have in yourself as a composed athlete. Read the statements below. Can
					you identify with any of these negative self-labels or statements?
				</p>
				<h4>Negative Self-Labels about Composure</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>I choked in the past and I will continue to be a choker.</li>
					<li>
						I am not a big game player; I never perform well in big games.
					</li>
					<li>Others call me a hot head; I must be a hot head.</li>
					<li>I’m a Type-A athlete; I can’t relax and play my game.</li>
					<li>
						I crumble under the pressure of a big lead and find a way to lose.
					</li>
					<li>
						When I perform, I feel as though I am going to see the executioner
						because I am so scared to play badly.
					</li>
					<li>
						I am “Mr. Tension” on the playing field and never seem to relax and
						perform free during competition.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Although extreme examples, these statements show the negative affect
					that a poor self-image has on your performance. Your athletic
					self-image dictates your behavior in competition and you will default
					to this type of thinking when you are under pressure or adversity.
				</p>
				<p>
					Could you identify with any of the negative self-labels listed above?
					What are the negative self-labels you have adopted that undermine your
					confidence and your ability to be a composed athlete? List them here:
