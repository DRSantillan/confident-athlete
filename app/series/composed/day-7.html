				<h3>Day 7 - Warm-up</h3>
				<p>
					Several mental game challenges are linked to fear of failure, such as
					low selfconfidence, worry about making mistakes, fear of rejection or
					embarrassment, and several others. One of the problems associated with
					the fear of failure is an intense need to avoid failure, which causes
					you to think too much about not making mistakes or avoiding pain; or
					causes you to perform cautiously, scared, or too defensively.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the goals of The Composed Athlete is to help you perform
					fearlessly, without the mental traps that hold back performance
					potential. One way to accomplish this is to help you adopt a
					success-driven mindset that focuses on what you want to accomplish and
					helps you strive for positive outcomes.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the last session you identified your specific fear of failure(s).
					Today, you’ll learn how to replace avoidance behavior with a
					success-driven mindset.

					“I wanted to be the best player in the world, and that was crazy
					coming out of the mouth of a 10 year old. But, as a 25 year old
					wanting to be the best was perfectly legit standing on the field of
					the world cup field.”

				<h3>Day 7 - Daily Composure Boost</h3>
				<p>
					A success driven- approach focuses on what you want to achieve and
					task-relevant performance cues. It’s a focus in the moment, the here
					and now, and what you have to do to achieve excellence, while
					concurrently having a positive goal in mind. Athletes who take a
					fear-driven approach to their sport become paralyzed by trying to
					avoid failure, pain, or mistakes.
				</p>
				<p>
					In table 10, I have listed common statements or beliefs athletes
					maintain that are avoidance behaviors. Your task is to become an
					expert at changing fear-driven statements into a success-driven
					statements.
