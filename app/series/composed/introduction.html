					A 14-Day Plan for Maximum Composure
				</h3>
				<p>
					Welcome to The Composed Athlete: A 14-day Plan for Maximum Composure.
					You cannot compete at the highest levels of performance without
					composure of mind. As a matter of fact, without composure you will not
					be able to compete at any level of your sport(s) because you will hold
					yourself back with self-sabotaging feelings of inadequacy, worry,
					doubt, and fear. These are strong terms that frequently are
					encountered by athletes, but composed athletes are not influenced by
					these kinds of mental game “ball-and-chains.”
				</p>
				<p>
					The Composed Athlete teaches you everything I share with my individual
					mental coaching students when working in the area of emotional control
					and coping with pressure encountered by athletes. At the end of this
					program, you will have learned the key mental strategies to help you
					perform with great calmness of mind and confidence in your own
					self-control and ability to stay composed in crunch-time. In The
					Composed Athlete I provide you with a system to identify what mental
					breakdowns hold you back from composure, how to develop a mindset to
					thrive under pressure, and how to let go of mistakes that cause you to
					dwell in the past.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					“We maintained our poise. That's part of the maturity of our team,
					especially on the road. We don't lose our composure, and we do the
					right things down the stretch.”
				</blockquote>
				<cite>~ Michael Jordan, After Winning 3rd Consecutive NBA title</cite>
				<p>
					Your goal every time you hit the field, court, or course is to think
					like a champion by not letting competitors get under your skin and
					affect your confidence through mental preparation to cope effectively
					with mistakes or adversity.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most athletes and coaches understand that composure is very important
					to success, yet do not know the mental triggers or beliefs that drain
					athletes from keeping a calm, level head in competition. Composure is
					a very broad term in my work with athletes and as you will soon learn;
					there may be other mental barriers that ultimately affect your level
					of composure on the playing field. For example: some athletes focus
					too much on having the perfect performance or looking good to others
					(such as teammates, parents, coaches) and these mindsets affect
					composure during competition. The very first step to gaining superior
					composure as a competitor is to look internally to uncover the
					ineffective attitudes that undermine your ability to hang tough in
					moments of adversity. Then, the next step is to apply mental
					strategies to overcome the mental hurdles that prevent you from having
					full composure.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the nearly two decades I’ve worked with athletes from all sports
					and all levels, I have learned that mental skills for composure can be
					learned just as an athlete works at developing a perfect swing in
					baseball or dismount in gymnastics. The Composed Athlete teaches you
					how to identify your mental roadblocks to composure AND develop the
					mindset needed to enter competition with complete composure and
					steadfastness.

				<h3>How to use this program</h3>

				<p>Each day you will be given specific tasks to complete to work on your composure.
Sometimes you will be given awareness exercises to help you identify mindsets that
either undermine or contribute to success in sports. At the end of 14 days, you
should be on your way to maximum composure in your sport. Every day of the
program is divided into daily tasks which you need to complete to gain the most
from the program. For maximum benefit from each daily composure boost, you
should complete all the tasks, starting with Day 1.
<p>Use the audio program that accompanies The Composed Athlete to help guide you
through the program. For example, you should listen to the audio for Day 1 and
then complete the workbook exercises for Day 1 before proceeding to the Day 2
audio and exercises.</p>
<p>Table 1, below, is a description of the daily tasks you will complete in each section
to enhance your focus.</p>
