				<h3>Day 4 - Warm-up</h3>
				<p>
					Social approval is a need to be accepted, respected, or liked by
					others, which is a very common behavior in today’s society. Research
					done by Wake Forest University shows that social approval and
					disapproval influences how people feel about themselves./p>
				</p>

				<p>
					Social approval is an important phenomenon in my discussions with
					athletes that I coach. Many athletes rely too much on social approval
					to boost their own levels of self-worth. Some athletes think that if
					others respect their sports performance, this, for some reason, will
					make them a better person. Many athletes buy into this notion and
					think that they are better people if they can achieve acknowledgement,
					gain approval or respect from others through sports.
				</p>
				<p>
					How is social approval related to emotional composure? The need for
					approval from others becomes another source of pressure for many
					athletes. Athletes that crave approval from others to feel better or
					more confident, often become anxious in competition because the
					opportunity for embarrassment is present.
				</p>
				<p>
					What happens when an athlete badly wants respect or admiration from
					others? He or she is afraid to lose approval points by playing poorly
					or making mistakes. This sounds like fear of failure and it is a
					certain type of fear of failure. However, most of the time, craving
					approval causes you to read the minds of others and not really know
					what they are actually thinking - just unsubstantiated mind reading!

				<h3>Day 4 - Composure Clip</h3>

				<blockquote>
					“There is a lot of pressure put on me by others, but I don’t put a lot
					of pressure on myself. I feel if I play my game, the outcome will take
					care of itself.”<cite>~Lebron James, NBA Basketball All-Star</cite>

				<h3>Day 4 - Daily Composure Boost</h3>
				<p>
					The first step is to seek out any approval cravings you might have.
					People are motivated for many reasons and gaining approval from others
					is one of them. Below are the top seven categories of social approval
					that impact athletes:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Want others to see you as an achieving or successful athlete.</li>
					<li>
						Want others to respect you for your abilities as an athlete./li>
					</li>
					<li>Want to have a certain status from a group of athletes.</li>
					<li>Want social recognition from fans, media, or coaches.</li>
					<li>Want to impress or make others happy, such as a parent.</li>
					<li>
						Want to avoid feeling embarrassed and having others think badly of
						you.
					</li>
					<li>
						Want to avoid performing poorly for fear of not gaining respect.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Using the list above, write down the top two or three needs for
					approval you have experienced in the past, knowingly or unknowingly.
					It could be a variation of any one of the seven statements above:
				</p>
				<div class="container">
					<div class="container__row">
						1.
						<div class="container__col">
							<input
								class="txt-input social-approval-need"
								type="text"
								name=""
								id="q1"
								placeholder="..."
							/>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="container__row">
						2.
						<div class="container__col">
							<input
								class="txt-input social-approval-need"
								type="text"
								name=""
								id="q2"
								placeholder="..."
							/>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="container__row">
						3.
						<div class="container__col">
							<input
								class="txt-input social-approval-need"
								type="text"
								name=""
								id="q3"
								placeholder="..."
							/>
						</div>
					</div>
					<button class="btn" id="saveSAN">Save</button
					><button class="btn" id="clearSAN">Clear</button>
				</div>
				<p>
					Once you identify the source of approval that you desire, consciously
					or unconsciously, you can tackle the issue head on. As you can see,
					some are desires (i.e., want respect from others) and some can be
					classified as fears (i.e., fear of embarrassment). Both have equal
					power to control you in competition.
				</p>
				<p>
					Given the two or three needs you identified above, the goal is to
					“convince” yourself that these needs are not relevant to your
					performance and should be a non-issue. To overcome the mental obstacle
					social approval creates is to debate the rationality of these needs
					and replace with a more effective belief system. Your objectives of
					this exercise are to:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Debate the rationality of a certain need you identified.</li>
					<li>Stop “mind reading” into what you think others think.</li>
					<li>
						Learn to approve of yourself and have self-respect and
						self-confidence.
					</li>
					<li>
						Learn to focus in the now, instead of worrying about what others may
						think if you perform well or poorly.
					</li>
				</ol>
