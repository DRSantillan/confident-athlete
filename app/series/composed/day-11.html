				<h3>Day 11 - Warm-up</h3>
				<p>
					In the last session we discussed how athletes become self-intimidated
					and introduced some strategies to help you perform free of
					intimidation. Athletes who intimidate themselves focus too much on
					other athletes and the situation rather than what is under his or her
					direct control. Thus, this lesson applies to helping you with
					intimidation as well as your general mindset for composure.
				</p>
				<p>
					Do you spend too much energy worrying about things that you cannot
					control on the athletic field, court, or course? For example, have you
					ever been side-tracked because you were arguing with an official about
					a bad call he made even when you knew the official was not going to
					change his call? Most likely, you became upset or frustrated, lost
					your composure and it affected you for several minutes to follow or
					even the rest of the game.
				</p>
				<p>
					Focusing on things that are beyond your control is a distraction at
					the very least. As we discussed in the case of intimidation, focusing
					too much on your opponent’s record or abilities can lead to composure
					breakdowns. We can classify all resultoriented thinking about outcomes
					into thoughts or “events” that are beyond your direct control (in the
					present moment). Athletes who focus too much on results, instead of
					the process, are likely to become anxious, scared, worried, and
					perform tentatively at best.
				</p>
				<p>
					As part of your plan for developing maximum composure, you must train
					yourself to focus only on the stuff in your personal and immediate
					control. Thus, we can break down the competitive arena into two areas:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Things that you control:</strong> your thoughts, behaviors,
						performance, and reactions in both practice and competition.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Things beyond your control:</strong> events or persons that
						you cannot influence during competition and which cause you to
						become sidetracked from your real mission such as a heckler in the
						stands or rude competitors.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Day 11 - Daily Composure Boost</h3>
				<p>
					The first step is to identify the areas in your performance that you
					can and cannot control. You probably have a good idea about this
					already given the topic of this workbook and what we have covered thus
					far. Table 13 describes in general some of the variables that are
					under your control in sports.
				</p>

				<p>
					The next step is to get more specific with the factors you can control
					in your specific sport and to identify the events or thoughts that
					cause you to get side tracked during practice or competition. I’ll use
					the sport of golf to highlight some specific examples of factors that
					you can and cannot control:
				</p>
				<h4>Factors you can control in putting</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Your preshot routine</li>
					<li>Your plan for the putt or read</li>
					<li>The images you use during the routine</li>
					<li>Your general mental preparation for the putt</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Factors you cannot control in putting</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>The condition of the greens</li>
					<li>How your playing partners behave</li>
					<li>The weather conditions</li>
					<li>
						The effects of wind, spike marks on the green, and the “lumpy donut”
						or shoe prints around the hole
					</li>
					<li>The final outcome of the putt</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Now it’s your turn. Please describe what you can control in your sport
					and the factors that are beyond your control in table 14.
