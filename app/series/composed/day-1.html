				<h3>Day 1 - Warm-up</h3>
				<p>The first characteristic of a composed athlete is the ability to remain calm, steadfast, or in control during crunch-time or competitive pressure. The composed
athlete is a “gamer” or the person who thrives under competitive pressure, such as Tiger Woods when he has the lead in a golf tournament. Athletes with composure are able to raise the level of their play during competition – they thrive when the battle is close.</p>
				<p>The second main attribute of a composed athlete is the ability to remain composed emotionally when challenged by misfortune or after committing a mistake, such as Roger Federer’s ability to quickly let go of errors. Do the best athletes in the world get upset by mistakes? You bet! However, these athletes do not dwell on past mistakes or let mistakes compound into more mistakes. They don’t linger on frustration or lose focus and their ability to think straight. A motto that I teach all my students comes from one of my early mentors in sports psychology, Dr. Ken Ravizza:</p>
<blockquote>“You first must be in control of yourself before you can control your performance.”</blockquote>
				<p>Some people think that either you have composure or you don’t, and that you can’t change this twist of fate. In other words, you are either born with the gift of composure or not. For example, they believe that if you are a Type A personality you can’t change the fact that you become anxious in competition. This is simply false. You can learn the mental strategies that will give you a greater sense of inner composure and confidence that will enable you to perform at your peak every time you are in competition!</p>
				<p>You can learn the mental strategies that will give you a greater sense of inner composure and confidence that will enable you to perform at your peak every time you are in competition!</p>
<p>
	<h4>Thus, in summary, composure in athletics includes the following elements:</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>The ability to think calmly and rationally when under competitive stress.</li>
		<li>The ability to react calmly and rationally to errors during competition.</li>
		<li>The ability to rise to the challenge with confidence when called upon or as needed.</li>
		<li>The ability to identify and quickly extinguish mental barriers that undermine composure and cheat you from peak performance.</li>
	<li>The ability to “want the ball” with 1 minute left in the game with the belief that there is no better person to win than you.</li></ol>
</p><p>As an added bonus, if you are a leader in your team and can display maximum composure, other athletes will follow your lead and have confidence in your ability
to lead with poise.</p>

				<h3>Day 1 - Composure Clip</h3>
				<blockquote>“Now I focus on each and every point. I try not to let things get to me. I’ve realized that has improved my
game. I feel very relaxed out on court, you know, like I am off the court. That works, for me, very well."</blockquote>
				<cite>~Rodger Federer, US Open 2006</cite>
